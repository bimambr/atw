**Clause-by-clause/Phrase-by-phrase Analysis:**

*   ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri, omong kosong"" - This is a fairly direct and natural translation. ""Omong kosong"" effectively captures the dismissive and sarcastic tone of ""my ass.""
*   ""was my instant, and silent, reaction"" -> ""itu reaksi instan, dan terdiam, saya rasakan."" - The translation is accurate but slightly clunky. ""Saya rasakan"" is a bit awkward. A better phrasing might be ""Itu reaksi instan yang terdiam, langsung terasa."" or ""Reaksi instan yang terdiam, langsung saya rasakan.""
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya terlebih dahulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - This is a largely accurate translation, but the sentence structure feels a bit stiff in Indonesian. ""Makamnya terlebih dahulu"" is grammatically correct but could be smoother. ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makam *Dell* terlebih dahulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" would improve clarity.
*   ""Of course this boy hadn't shot himself."" -> ""Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri."" - Accurate and natural.
*   ""Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend."" -> ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti kekasihnya yang pemberontak."" - Accurate and natural.
*   ""I opened my eyes."" -> ""Saya membuka mata."" - Simple and accurate.
*   ""Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing."" -> ""Hollis Boxleitner berputar untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan."" - Accurate, but ""berputar"" might sound a little formal. ""Hollis Boxleitner berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan"" is a more natural alternative.
*   ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius petugas polisi itu."" - ""Serius"" is a good translation for ""intent"" in this context. ""Petugas polisi itu"" is a clear and accurate way to say ""the deputy.""
*   ""No suicide here,"" I said. -> ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku. - Accurate and natural.

**Overall Coherence:**

The translation is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, it lacks a certain fluency and naturalness. Some phrases feel a bit literal and could be improved for a more idiomatic Indonesian reading experience. The sentence structure in some parts is a little stiff. The overall tone is maintained, but the nuances of the original English are not always perfectly captured.

**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**

*   The use of ""terdiam"" in ""reaksi instan yang terdiam"" is a bit redundant.
*   Consider rephrasing sentences to improve flow and avoid overly literal translations.
*   Pay attention to sentence structure to make it sound more natural in Indonesian.
*   While ""petugas polisi itu"" is correct, consider if a more concise phrasing is possible without losing meaning.

*   ""was my instant, and silent, reaction"" -> ""itu adalah reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya."" - Grammatically correct, but the placement of ""saya"" (I) feels slightly awkward. It's better to place it closer to the verb.
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - This is a relatively accurate translation, but the sentence structure is a bit clunky in Indonesian. The phrasing ""membaca makamnya dulu"" (read his grave first) is a bit formal and could be smoother.

*   ""Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend."" -> ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar wanitanya yang ceroboh."" - ""Ceroboh"" (wild/careless) is a good translation of ""wild"" in this context.

*   ""No suicide here,"" I said. -> ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku. - Accurate and natural.

**Overall Coherence:**

The translation is generally understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, the Indonesian feels somewhat literal in places, lacking the natural flow and stylistic nuances of a native speaker. The sentence structure in the longer sentences could be improved for better readability. The use of ""saya"" sometimes feels a little forced.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Sentence Structure:** Rephrase the sentence ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" to something like: ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?) This improves the flow.
2.  **Word Choice:** Consider alternatives to ""membaca makamnya"" (read his grave) which might sound more natural, such as ""mengecek makamnya"" (check his grave) or ""mengunjungi makamnya"" (visit his grave), depending on the desired nuance.
3.  **Placement of Pronouns:** In sentences like ""itu adalah reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya,"" consider placing ""saya"" closer to the verb: ""Saya merasakan reaksi instan, dan sunyi."" (I felt an instant, silent reaction.)
4.  **Tone:** While ""omong kosong"" is good, ensure the overall tone remains consistent with the original's sarcastic and slightly cynical voice.

**Clause-by-clause analysis:**

*   **""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less.""**
    *   ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - This is a generally accurate translation. ""Penipu ulung"" is a good equivalent for ""confidence trickster."" ""Bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" effectively conveys ""even less.""
*   **""I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick.""**
    *   ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku."" - ""Menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri"" is a good translation of ""retreat inside myself."" ""Kesadaranku"" is a reasonable, though slightly less common, translation of ""my quick"" in this context. ""Quick"" here refers to wit or cleverness, and ""kesadaran"" can imply awareness or consciousness.
*   **""Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful.""**
    *   ""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a straightforward and accurate translation. ""Kurang berhasil"" is a natural way to say ""less successful.""
*   **""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.""**
    *   ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kami."" - ""Sangat kesal"" accurately conveys ""very upset."" ""Mencemarkan nama baik"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor.""

**Phrase-by-phrase analysis:**

*   ""confidence trickster"" -> ""penipu ulung"" - Accurate and commonly used.
*   ""retreat inside myself"" -> ""menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri"" - Accurate and natural.
*   ""touch my quick"" -> ""menyentuh kesadaranku"" - While ""quick"" is idiomatic, ""kesadaran"" is a suitable, if slightly less vivid, translation.
*   ""impugn our honor"" -> ""mencemarkan nama baik kami"" - Accurate and conveys the meaning well.

**Overall Coherence:**

The translation is coherent and understandable. The flow is natural, and the Indonesian reads well. The use of vocabulary is appropriate for the tone of the novel excerpt.

**Issues and Suggestions:**

*   While ""kesadaranku"" is accurate for ""my quick,"" it might benefit from a slightly more evocative phrase to capture the nuance of cleverness or quick wit. Consider ""kecerdasanku"" (my intelligence) or ""cerdikku"" (my cleverness), although these might slightly alter the original meaning. However, ""kesadaranku"" is perfectly acceptable.
*   The repetition of ""aku"" (I) could be slightly varied for a more natural flow, although it's not strictly necessary.

External knowledge:     - Novel synopsis: The narrator, Harper Connelly, has what you might call a strange job: she finds dead people. She can sense the final location of a person who's passed, and share their very last moment. The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent - even if the dead can wait forever.
    - Previous paragraph: WE had a dismal time at the police station. The state police thought I was a blood-sucking leech. I'd anticipated their attitude as we drove into town, but it wore me out anyway. The male faces followed each other in slow succession. Thin, heavy, white, black, intelligent, dense; they all shared an opinion of me they didn't take any pains to hide. I guess they thought Tolliver was the enabler of the blood-sucking leech.
            

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.

**Clause-by-clause analysis:**

*   **""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster...""** - ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung..."" This is a fairly direct and accurate translation. ""Penipu ulung"" captures the essence of ""confidence trickster"" well.
*   **""...and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less.""** - ""...dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka."" This is also a good translation. ""Bahkan lebih tidak suka"" effectively conveys the intensified dislike.
*   **""I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick.""** - ""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya."" ""Menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri"" is a suitable translation of ""retreat inside myself."" ""Saraf saya"" is a reasonable interpretation of ""my quick,"" although it might be slightly less evocative.
*   **""Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful.""** - ""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" This is a straightforward and accurate translation.
*   **""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.""** - ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan kehormatan kami."" ""Mencemarkan kehormatan kami"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor.""

**Phrase-by-phrase analysis:**

*   ""confidence trickster"" -> ""penipu ulung"": Accurate and commonly understood.
*   ""touch my quick"" -> ""menyentuh saraf saya"": While ""quick"" can have multiple meanings, ""saraf"" (nerve) works well in this context to imply a sensitive spot or vulnerability.
*   ""impugn our honor"" -> ""mencemarkan kehormatan kami"": A solid translation, conveying the meaning of damaging or discrediting their honor.

**Overall Coherence:**

The translation is coherent and flows naturally in Indonesian. The sentence structure is appropriate, and the vocabulary choices are generally fitting for the context. The tone is maintained well, reflecting the narrator's somewhat cynical and world-weary attitude.

**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**

*   While ""saraf saya"" is understandable, consider ""hati saya"" (my heart) for ""my quick"" to add a slightly more emotional nuance, aligning with the character's internal state. However, ""saraf"" is not incorrect.
*   ""Mencemarkan kehormatan kami"" is a bit formal. Depending on the overall tone of the novel, ""merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (to belittle our honor) could be a slightly more natural alternative, though it depends on the desired level of formality.

**Clause-by-clause/Phrase-by-phrase Analysis:**

*   **""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.** - This is a straightforward sentence. The translation is accurate and natural.
*   **""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often.** - ""Okay"" translates well to ""Baiklah."" ""Slowly"" is accurately rendered as ""perlahan."" The sentence structure is maintained effectively.
*   **""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""** - This is a complex sentence with multiple clauses. The translation is generally good, but the phrasing could be smoother. ""Jauh dari jalan utama"" is a good equivalent for ""off the beaten road."" ""Kabin kayu sungguhan"" accurately conveys ""real log cabin."" ""Mengubahnya sedikit"" is a natural way to say ""alter it a little.""
*   **""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer.** - ""Tentu"" is a perfect translation of ""Of course."" ""Menyesap bir"" is a natural and common way to describe taking a sip of beer in Indonesian.

**Overall Coherence:**

The translation is mostly accurate and understandable. However, the Indonesian feels slightly formal in places, particularly in the longer sentence. While grammatically correct, it lacks a certain conversational flow. The use of ""Tentu saja"" repeated twice feels a little redundant.

**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**

1.  **Redundancy:** The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" could be softened. Consider replacing the second instance with a simpler phrase like ""Tentu saja, tapi..."" (Of course, but...).
2.  **Flow:** The long sentence could be broken down for better readability. For example: ""Tentu saja, tapi aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit."" (Of course, but I want to change it a little.)
3.  **Naturalness:** While ""jauh dari jalan utama"" is correct, consider ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a remote location) for a slightly more natural feel, depending on the desired nuance.

**Alternative Phrasings:**

*   Instead of ""Tentu saja, tapi aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit,"" consider ""Aku tentu saja ingin mengubahnya sedikit."" (I certainly want to change it a little.)
*   For ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" instead of ""jauh dari jalan utama.""

**Overall Coherence:**

The revised translation is significantly improved. The use of ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" enhances the imagery. The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is still present, but the overall flow is better, and the sentence structure is more natural.

**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**

1.  **Redundancy:** The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is still present. While less jarring than before, it could still be refined.
2.  **Flow:** The long sentence remains a bit cumbersome. Consider breaking it into two shorter sentences for improved readability.

**Alternative Phrasings:**

*   Instead of ""Aku tentu saja ingin mengubahnya sedikit,"" consider ""Aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit, tentu saja."" (I want to change it a little, of course.) This slightly reorders the sentence and might improve the flow.
*   Consider splitting the long sentence into two: ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus di lokasi yang terpencil. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan membelinya. Aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit."" (Of course, the house must be in a remote location. I found the plans on the internet and bought them. I want to change it a little.)

**Clause-by-clause/Phrase-by-phrase Analysis:**

*   **""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.** - This is a straightforward sentence. The translation is accurate and natural.
*   **""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often.** - ""Okay"" translates well to ""Baiklah."" ""Slowly"" is accurately rendered as ""perlahan."" The phrase ""didn't talk about too often"" is well translated as ""jarang sekali ku bicarakan.""
*   **""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""** - This is a complex sentence with several clauses. The translation is generally accurate, but the phrasing could be smoother. ""Off the beaten road"" is well translated as ""di tempat yang terpencil."" ""Inconveniences"" is accurately rendered as ""ketidaknyamanan."" ""Alter it a little"" is fine, but could be slightly more natural.
*   **""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer.** - ""Of course"" translates well to ""Tentu saja."" ""Taking a sip of beer"" is accurately rendered as ""menyesap bir.""

**Overall Coherence:**

The translation is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, it lacks a certain fluency and naturalness. The sentence structure in the translated version is a bit clunky in places. The use of ""ku"" (a contraction of ""saya"" - I) is appropriate for informal speech, which fits the tone of the excerpt. However, the overall flow could be improved with some minor adjustments.

**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**

1.  **""It will have to be off the beaten road...""** - While ""di tempat yang terpencil"" is accurate, it's a bit literal. A more idiomatic translation could be ""Harus berada di lokasi yang terpencil..."" (Must be in a remote location...) or ""Aku ingin rumah itu berada jauh dari keramaian..."" (I want the house to be far from the crowds...).
2.  **""...but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin.""** - This is grammatically correct, but a more natural phrasing would be ""...tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu yang asli."" (...but without the problems usually found in a real log cabin.)
3.  **""I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it.""** - This is fine, but could be slightly more concise: ""Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet dan membelinya."" (I found the plans online and bought them.)
4.  **""But of course, I want to alter it a little.""** - ""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit"" is correct, but consider ""Namun, aku ingin sedikit memodifikasinya."" (However, I want to modify it a little.) ""Memodifikasi"" sounds slightly more natural in this context.

3,2,2,2022,0.3,927,0.01,"""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer.","""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.

""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku bicarakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di lokasi yang terpencil.

Namun, aku ingin sedikit memodifikasinya.""

""Tentu saja,"" katanya, menyesap bir.",evaluator,N/A,pass,"--- EVALUATION ---

**Clause-by-clause/Phrase-by-phrase Analysis:**

*   **""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.** - Accurate and natural.
*   **""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku bicarakan.** - ""Baiklah"" is appropriate. ""Perlahan"" is accurate. ""Jarang sekali ku bicarakan"" is a good translation of ""didn't talk about too often.""
*   **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di lokasi yang terpencil. Aku ingin rumah itu berbentuk pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu yang asli. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet dan membelinya. Namun, aku ingin sedikit memodifikasinya.""** - This is a significant improvement. The use of ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" is more idiomatic than ""di tempat yang terpencil."" ""Berbentuk pondok kayu"" is a natural way to say ""look like a log cabin."" ""Masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu yang asli"" accurately conveys the meaning of ""inconveniences of a real log cabin."" ""Memodifikasinya"" is a good alternative to ""mengubahnya sedikit.""
*   **""Tentu saja,"" katanya, menyesap bir.** - Accurate and natural.

**Overall Coherence:**

The revised translation is significantly more fluent and natural than the previous attempt. The sentence structure is smoother, and the word choices are more idiomatic. The overall tone and style are well maintained. The use of ""ku"" remains appropriate for the narrator's voice.

**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**

There are no significant issues. The translation is well-executed and effectively conveys the meaning of the original text. The changes made address the previous shortcomings and result in a more polished and natural-sounding Indonesian translation.

**Overall Coherence:** The translation is generally understandable, but lacks natural flow and precision. The use of ""akan ada"" (there will be) is repetitive and can be improved. The overall tone is somewhat stiff and doesn't quite capture the narrator's casual, slightly detached voice.

**Clause-by-Clause/Phrase-by-Phrase Analysis:**

*   ""It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room."" -> ""Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga."" This is a direct and accurate translation. No issues.
*   ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" -> ""Di sini ada dapur, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya.""  ""Tepat di sebelahnya"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing might be ""tepat di sampingnya"" or ""berdekatan dengan.""
*   ""I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger."" -> ""Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku."" Accurate and natural.
*   ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet."" -> ""Di belakang, akan ada *carport* untuk mobil, jadi Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" The use of ""*carport*"" is a good choice, as ""porte cochere"" is not a common term. However, ""langsung ke dapur"" is a bit clunky. ""Ke dapur"" would be more natural.
*   ""There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room."" -> ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di ruang keluarga."" ""Tahu?"" is a direct translation of ""see?"" and works, but could be replaced with a more idiomatic expression like ""bisa juga"" (could also).
*   ""That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks."" -> ""Di sana akan ada perapian, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan Anda bisa meletakkan *barbecue gas* di teras. Untuk steak."" ""Barbecue gas"" is a good translation of ""gas grill."" The sentence is grammatically correct, but the repetition of ""Anda bisa"" (you can) is noticeable. It could be rephrased for better flow.

**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**

*   **Repetitive phrasing:** The overuse of ""akan ada"" and ""Anda bisa"" makes the text sound monotonous. Varying sentence structure and using pronouns where appropriate would improve the flow.
*   **Formal tone:** The translation leans towards a more formal tone than the original. Injecting more casual language would better reflect Harper's personality.
*   **""Tahu?""**: While understandable, it's a bit too literal. Consider alternatives like ""bisa juga"" or simply omitting it if the meaning is clear.
*   **""Tepat di sebelahnya""**: Consider ""tepat di sampingnya"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" for a more natural feel.

The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast.

**Overall Coherence:** The translation is generally understandable, but lacks natural flow and precision. It reads somewhat clunky and doesn't fully capture the conversational tone of the original. The use of ""aku"" is appropriate for the narrator's voice, but the overall sentence structure feels overly literal.

**Clause-by-Clause Analysis:**

*   **""It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room."" -> ""Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.""** This is a direct and accurate translation. ""Ruang kerja"" is a good equivalent for ""study"" in this context.
*   **""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" -> ""Di belakang rumah, akan ada teras untuk mobil, jadi Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.""** This is a significant deviation and introduces a new element (""teras untuk mobil"" - car portico) that isn't present in the original. The phrase ""di belakang rumah"" (at the back of the house) is also misplaced and disrupts the flow. The original sentence describes the location of the kitchen relative to the washroom, not the location of the car portico.
*   **""I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger."" -> ""jawabku sambil menatap meja dan menggambar dengan jari.""** This is a reasonable translation, but the ""jawabku"" (I answered) feels a bit abrupt. A more natural phrasing might be ""Sambil menatap meja, aku menggambar dengan jari."" (While looking at the table, I drew with my finger.)
*   **""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet."" -> ""Di belakang rumah, akan ada teras untuk mobil, jadi Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.""** As noted in the context, ""*porte cochere*"" is not a common term in Indonesian. Translating it as ""teras untuk mobil"" (car portico) is a poor choice and changes the meaning. A better approach would be to use a descriptive phrase like ""tempat berteduh untuk mobil"" (shelter for cars) or ""area parkir tertutup"" (covered parking area), depending on the desired level of formality. The phrase ""tanpa basah-basah"" (without getting wet) is a bit informal and could be replaced with a more elegant phrasing like ""tanpa perlu terkena hujan"" (without needing to be exposed to rain).
*   **""There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room."" -> ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga.""** The use of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is a direct translation of ""see?"" and works, but it can sound a bit unnatural. A more natural alternative would be ""atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" (or maybe I will place it next to the family room.)
*   **""That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks."" -> ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan Anda bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.""** This is a relatively accurate translation, but the repetition of ""Anda bisa"" (you can) is a bit monotonous. It could be rephrased to improve the flow.

**Specific Issues:**

*   **Inaccurate translation of ""porte cochere"":** This is a major error that significantly alters the meaning.
*   **Awkward phrasing:** Some sentences are overly literal and lack natural flow.
*   **Repetitive sentence structure:** The frequent use of ""Anda bisa"" makes the text sound monotonous.
*   **Misplaced information:** The initial phrase about the car portico is incorrectly placed.

Dan Anda bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.""** Accurate and maintains the original meaning. The repetition of ""Anda bisa"" is still present, but it's less jarring than in the previous version.

**Specific Improvements:**

*   **Accurate translation of ""porte cochere"":** The use of ""area parkir tertutup untuk mobil"" is a significant improvement.
*   **Improved flow and naturalness:** The revised sentences read more smoothly and naturally in Indonesian.
*   **More elegant phrasing:** The use of ""tanpa perlu terkena hujan"" is a more sophisticated way of expressing the idea of avoiding getting wet.

**Remaining Minor Issues:**

*   The repetition of ""Anda bisa"" could be further improved with more varied sentence structures. However, it's not a critical error.
