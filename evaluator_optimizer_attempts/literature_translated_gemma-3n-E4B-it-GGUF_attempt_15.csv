The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective character's internal monologue. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""wild girlfriend""). The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and explaining their current location and observations. The style is concise and focused on conveying information efficiently.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. While ""Omong kosong"" means nonsense, it doesn't carry the same level of contempt or disbelief as ""my ass"" in this context. The sentence structure is also slightly clunky in Indonesian.

The phrase ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal and indirect. A more natural phrasing would be needed to reflect the narrator's frustrated tone. The use of ""terlebih dahulu"" (first) is redundant and can be simplified.

The translation of ""intent face"" as ""wajah serius wakil"" is accurate but lacks nuance. ""Intent"" implies a focused, serious, and perhaps even stern expression. ""Serius"" simply means serious. A better option would be something that conveys the intensity of the deputy's gaze.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" - Needs a more impactful and colloquial equivalent. Consider options like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh*"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid) or ""*Bunuh diri? Mimpi saja*"" (Suicide? Dream on).
*   ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - Needs restructuring for better flow and a more natural tone. Consider: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to look for Teenie?)
*   ""wajah serius wakil"" - Needs a more evocative description. Consider: ""wajah tegas wakil"" (the deputy's stern face) or ""tatapan tajam wakil"" (the deputy's sharp gaze).

A more natural translation could be: ""*Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh gue duluan ke makamnya, daripada nyuruh ke hutan buat nyari Teenie?*"" (This uses a more informal ""nggak"" for ""tidak"" and ""gue"" for ""saya,"" making it sound more conversational). Alternatively, ""*Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, bukannya mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?*"" (using ""memeriksa"" which implies a closer look than just visiting).
*   ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil"" - Consider: ""*Saya menatap wajah tegang wakil.*"" (tense face) or ""*Saya menatap wajah serius wakil itu.*"" (the serious face of the deputy), to add more descriptive detail.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective character's internal monologue. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""wild girlfriend""). The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and stating that a murder has occurred. The style is concise and focuses on conveying information efficiently.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a direct translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which is too literal and doesn't capture the dismissive, sarcastic tone. ""Omong kosong"" translates to ""nonsense"" and doesn't convey the same level of contempt.

The sentence ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat clunky in Indonesian. The phrasing is a bit too formal and lacks the conversational flow of the original. ""Mengunjungi makamnya"" (visit his grave) is a bit stiff; a more natural phrasing would be needed.

""Wajah serius wakil"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy."" While understandable, it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Intent"" in this context implies a focused, serious, and perhaps even stern expression. A better translation would convey this sense of seriousness.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""*Suicide, my ass*"" -> ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" - Needs a more idiomatic and dismissive phrase. Consider options like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh*"" (Suicide? Don't be foolish) or ""*Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin*"" (Suicide? Impossible), depending on the desired level of informality.
*   ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - Needs restructuring for better flow. Consider: ""*Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?*"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to look for Teenie?)
*   ""Wajah serius wakil"" - Needs a more evocative description. Consider: ""*Ekspresi wajah wakil yang serius*"" (The serious expression on the deputy's face) or ""*Wajah wakil yang tampak serius*"" (The deputy's face looked serious).

2. ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu"" should become ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk pergi ke makamnya dulu?"". This makes the sentence flow more naturally.
3. ""pacar wanitanya yang bersemangat"" could be improved to ""pacar yang penuh gairah"" or ""pacar yang agak liar"". This better captures the meaning of ""wild girlfriend.""
4. Consider replacing ""wakil"" with a more common term for ""deputy"" in Indonesian, such as ""satpam"" (security guard) if appropriate for the context, or simply retaining ""deputi"" if it's a standard term used in crime reporting.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective character's internal monologue. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""wild girlfriend""). The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and stating that a murder has occurred. The style is concise and focuses on conveying information efficiently.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a direct translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which is too literal and doesn't capture the dismissive, sarcastic tone. While ""Omong kosong"" means nonsense, it doesn't carry the same level of contempt or disbelief as the original. The sentence structure is also slightly clunky in places, making it less fluid than the original.

Specifically:

1. ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" - This lacks the sarcastic bite of ""Suicide, my ass."" Consider alternatives that convey disbelief and dismissal, such as ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh,"" or ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.""
2. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - The phrasing is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less natural than the original. A more natural phrasing could be: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (using ""memeriksa"" for ""read"" in the context of checking a grave).
3. ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu."" - While accurate, ""serius"" is a bit bland. Consider using a word that better conveys the intensity of the deputy's expression, such as ""tegas"" (firm/stern) or ""mengkhawatirkan"" (worrying).

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries an underlying emotional intensity. The phrase ""confidence trickster"" suggests a feeling of being unfairly accused or misunderstood, implying a past experience or perception of being deceived. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression indicating vulnerability and emotional sensitivity; it doesn't refer to a physical part of the body. ""Impugn our honor"" is a formal way of saying to attack someone's reputation or integrity. The overall meaning revolves around the speaker's discomfort with being perceived negatively and Tolliver's similar sensitivity regarding their reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone compared to the original. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, which is understandable but lacks the nuance of the original. It sounds a bit clunky in Indonesian. ""Saraf saya"" translates ""quick"" literally as ""nerve,"" which doesn't capture the figurative meaning of emotional sensitivity. A more idiomatic translation would be needed. ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it could be strengthened.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"": While accurate, ""penipu ulung"" sounds overly literal and less natural than other options. Consider alternatives that convey the feeling of being unfairly labeled or accused. For example, ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seolah-olah saya adalah penipu"" (I don't like being treated as if I were a swindler) or ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang dicurigai melakukan penipuan"" (I don't like being treated like someone suspected of fraud).

2. ""menyentuh saraf saya"": This is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't convey the intended meaning of emotional vulnerability. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh perasaan saya"" (touching my feelings), ""membuat saya rentan"" (making me vulnerable), or ""mengganggu sensitivitas saya"" (disturbing my sensitivity).

3. ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami"": While grammatically correct, ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" is a bit formal and could be made more impactful.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it captures the essence of ""confidence trickster,"" it might be too harsh depending on the context. A more natural phrasing could be ""penipu"" (trickster/con artist) or ""seolah-olah aku adalah penipu"" (as if I were a trickster). The phrase ""bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward. It could be improved to ""bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya"" (even less likes it) or ""bahkan lebih tersinggung"" (even more offended).

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku."" - ""Menyentuh kesadaranku"" (touch my consciousness) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't convey the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's cleverness, wit, or vulnerabilities. A better translation would be ""menyentuh akal sehatku"" (touch my common sense/reasoning), ""memainkan kecerdasanku"" (play on my intelligence), or ""memanfaatkan kelebihanku"" (exploit my strengths).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This part is relatively well translated.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal.

The phrase ""confidence trickster"" implies a feeling of being misunderstood and unfairly accused.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, which is a bit clunky in Indonesian. While understandable, it doesn't capture the subtle implication of being unfairly labeled. ""Saraf saya"" (my nerves) is a literal translation of ""quick,"" but it doesn't convey the emotional impact intended. A more idiomatic translation would be needed to reflect the feeling of being deeply affected. ""Mencoreng kehormatan kita"" is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it sounds somewhat formal and stiff.

The original phrasing is a bit too direct and lacks the subtle feeling of unfair accusation.
*   **""...dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya.""** This part is fine, but could be slightly more emphatic: ""...dan saya yakin Tolliver *sangat* tidak menyukainya."" (and I'm sure Tolliver *really* doesn't like it.)
*   **""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya.""** ""Menyentuh saraf saya"" is not idiomatic.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and emotional vulnerability. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to nerves or sensitivity) and ""impugn"" (meaning to attack someone's reputation). The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. The style is relatively straightforward, focusing on clear communication of the character's internal state and reactions.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite match the original.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it conveys the meaning of ""confidence trickster,"" it might be too intense. A more natural phrasing could be ""penipu"" (trickster) or ""orang yang suka menipu"" (someone who likes to deceive), depending on the desired level of formality. The second part, ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi,"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit redundant. ""Bahkan lebih tidak suka"" would be more concise and natural.

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya."" - ""menyentuh saraf saya"" (touch my nerves) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick,"" but it lacks the nuance. ""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's sensitive spots or vulnerabilities. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh kelemahan saya"" (touch my weaknesses) or ""membuat saya tersinggung"" (make me offended).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is a bit formal. While accurate, it doesn't quite capture the intensity of ""impugn."" Consider using ""menuduh kami tidak jujur"" (accuse us of being dishonest) or ""meragukan integritas kami"" (doubt our integrity).

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and emotional vulnerability. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to nerves or sensitivity) and ""impugn"" (meaning to attack someone's reputation). The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. The style is relatively straightforward, focusing on clear communication of the character's internal state and reactions.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite match the original.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it conveys the meaning of ""confidence trickster,"" it might be too intense. A more natural phrasing could be ""penipu"" (trickster) or ""orang yang suka menipu"" (someone who likes to deceive), depending on the desired level of formality. The second part, ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi,"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit redundant. ""Bahkan lebih tidak suka"" would be more concise and natural.

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya."" - ""menyentuh saraf saya"" (touch my nerves) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick,"" but it lacks the nuance. ""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's sensitive spots or vulnerabilities. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh kelemahan saya"" (touch my weaknesses) or ""membuat saya tersinggung"" (make me offended).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is a bit formal. While accurate, it doesn't quite capture the intensity of ""impugn."" Consider using ""menuduh kami tidak jujur"" (accuse us of being dishonest) or ""meragukan integritas kami"" (doubt our integrity).

""Quick"" here refers to a person's emotional core, vulnerability, or sensitivity. A more appropriate translation would be something like ""perasaan"" (feelings) or ""jiwa"" (soul).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This part is relatively well translated.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is a literal translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it lacks the force and formality of the original. ""Mencoreng"" implies a more casual or less deliberate act of damaging reputation than ""impugn."" A better option would be to use a phrase that conveys a stronger sense of direct attack on character, such as ""mencemarkan nama baik kami"" (to tarnish our good name) or ""menuduh kami melakukan kesalahan"" (to accuse us of wrongdoing).

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision. The core meaning is conveyed, but the language is often too literal and lacks the subtle emotional impact of the original. Specifically:

1.  **""penipu ulung""**: Replace with a phrase that implies subtle manipulation or vulnerability rather than outright fraud (e.g., ""orang yang suka memanfaatkan orang lain"" - someone who likes to take advantage of others).
2.  **""kesadaran""**: Replace with ""perasaan"" or ""jiwa"" to better capture the emotional core.
3.  **""mencoreng kehormatan kami""**: Replace with a stronger phrase that conveys a direct attack on character (e.g., ""menuduh kami melakukan kesalahan"" or ""mencemarkan nama baik kami"").

--- NEW TRANSLATION (The Implementation) ---
Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang suka memanfaatkan orang lain, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya. Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh perasaan-ku. Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil. Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kami.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language to convey details about the house. The meaning is clear and easy to understand, focusing on the narrator's preferences and desires for their ideal home. There are a few instances of informal language (""off the beaten road,"" ""a little"") that contribute to the casual tone.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and unnatural sentence structure in Indonesian. While the core meaning is preserved, the flow isn't as smooth as it could be.

""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" - This translates ""off the beaten road"" literally as ""far from the crowd,"" which doesn't quite capture the intended meaning of a secluded location. A better translation would be ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place) or ""terpencil"" (remote).

""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" - The phrasing is a bit clunky. ""Tampilannya seperti pondok kayu"" is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural. A more natural way to say this would be ""Aku ingin rumahnya terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kekurangan pondok kayu asli."" (I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the drawbacks of a real log cabin.)

""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya."" - This is grammatically correct, but ""tepat di sampingnya"" sounds a bit formal and less natural than simply ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to).

The use of the loanword ""*porte cochere*"" is appropriate, but it should be consistently translated as such throughout the text.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the description.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency. 

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While literally correct, it's a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place) or ""terpencil"" (remote). The original implies a sense of seclusion rather than just distance from crowds.
2. ""pondok kayu yang asli"" - This is redundant. ""Pondok kayu"" already implies a log cabin. It should simply be ""pondok kayu.""
3. ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang asli"" - This phrase is awkward and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. The original refers to the inherent inconveniences of a real log cabin (e.g., potential for drafts, maintenance). A better translation would be something like ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (but without the usual problems associated with log cabins) or ""tetapi dengan kenyamanan modern.""
4. ""tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal. ""Tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" would be more natural.
5. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is overly literal and clunky. A smoother phrasing would be ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" or ""Perapian akan berada di sana.""
6. The repetition of ""di teras"" (on the deck) feels slightly repetitive and could be rephrased for better flow.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the description.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency. 

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While literally correct, it's a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place) or ""terpencil"" (remote). The original implies a sense of seclusion rather than just distance from crowds.
2. ""pondok kayu yang asli"" - This is redundant. ""Pondok kayu"" already implies a log cabin. It should simply be ""pondok kayu.""
3. ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang asli"" - This phrase is awkward and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. The original refers to the inherent inconveniences of a real log cabin (e.g., potential for drafts, maintenance). A better translation would be something like ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (but without the usual problems associated with log cabins) or ""tetapi dengan kenyamanan modern.""
4. ""tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal. ""Tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" would be more natural.
5. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is overly literal and clunky. A smoother phrasing would be ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" or ""Perapian akan berada di sana.""
6. The repetition of ""di teras"" (on the deck) feels slightly repetitive and could be rephrased for better flow.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to improve its naturalness and stylistic flow. Specifically:

*   Replace ""jauh dari keramaian"" with ""di tempat yang tenang"" or ""terpencil.""
*   Remove the redundant ""yang asli"" from ""pondok kayu yang asli.""
*   Rephrase ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang asli"" to something like ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" or ""tetapi dengan kenyamanan modern.""
*   Replace ""tepat di sampingnya"" with ""tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan.""
*   Rephrase ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" to ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" or ""Perapian akan berada di sana.""
*   Vary the phrasing when referring to the deck to avoid repetition. For example, instead of ""Di teras,"" consider using ""di beranda"" (on the veranda) or simply ""di luar"" (outside) in some instances.

3.  **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" (the inconveniences of a real log cabin)** is grammatically correct but sounds awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""kekurangan rumah kayu sungguhan"" (the drawbacks of a real log cabin) or ""masalah yang biasanya ada di rumah kayu sungguhan"" (the problems usually found in a real log cabin).

4.  **""tepat di sampingnya"" (right next to it)** for ""right off of it."" This is a literal translation and sounds unnatural. A better option would be ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) or ""langsung di sebelah"" (directly next to).

5.  **Repetitive use of ""di"" (at/in)**: The phrase ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada..."" and ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur..."" becomes monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve readability. For example, instead of ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere*..."", try ""Sebelah belakang rumah akan dilengkapi dengan *porte cochere*...""

6.  **""lihat?"" (see?)**: This interjection is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone of the text. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural transition, such as ""Anda lihat?"" (You see?) or simply a period.

7. **""Untuk steak."" (For steak.)**: While understandable, it feels abrupt. A smoother phrasing would be ""Untuk memanggang steak."" (To grill steak) or ""Untuk menikmati steak."" (To enjoy steak).

needs_revision

The translation needs revision to improve its naturalness and stylistic consistency. Specifically, the translator should focus on using more precise vocabulary to accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text while maintaining a conversational tone. The overuse of certain words and phrases also needs to be addressed to enhance readability. The suggestions above provide specific examples of how to improve the translation.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, focusing on details of the house's features. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its amenities. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better translation would be something like ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location). This maintains the meaning while sounding more idiomatic.
2.  **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: The phrase is grammatically correct, but it's a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""kekurangan pondok kayu biasa"" (the drawbacks of a regular log cabin) or ""masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (the problems usually found in log cabins).
3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is a literal translation of ""right off of it."" While understandable, it's not the most elegant way to express this idea. ""Berdekatan dengan"" (close to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to) would be more natural.
4.  **Repetitive use of ""akan ada""**: The phrase ""akan ada"" (there will be) is repeated multiple times, making the text sound monotonous. Varying the sentence structure and using synonyms like ""ada"" (there is/are) or rephrasing the sentences would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Akan ada dapur di sini..."", try ""Dapur akan berada di sini..."" or ""Di sini ada dapur..."".
5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and doesn't fit the conversational tone. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural expression like ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply implied.
6. **""Untuk steak.""**: This feels abrupt and slightly unnatural. A better phrasing would be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (To grill steaks) or ""Untuk memasak steak"" (To cook steaks).

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that affect its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Off the beaten road"" implies remoteness and a sense of seclusion, not just distance from crowds. A better translation would be something like ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a remote location).

2.  **""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya""**: The phrase ""real log cabin"" is translated as ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya."" While understandable, it's slightly redundant. ""Sebenarnya"" (actually/really) isn't necessary and makes the sentence clunky. A more natural translation would be ""pondok kayu asli"" (authentic log cabin) or ""pondok kayu yang sesungguhnya"" (the true log cabin).

3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it."" It's grammatically correct but sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A more idiomatic translation would be ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) or ""di sebelah kamar mandi"" (next to the bathroom).

4.  **Repetitive use of ""akan ada""**: The phrase ""akan ada"" (there will be) is repeated multiple times, making the text sound monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Akan ada dapur di sini..."", consider ""Dapur akan berada di sini..."" or ""Di sini ada dapur..."".

5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and doesn't fit the conversational tone. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural expression like ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply implied.

6. **""Untuk steak.""**: This feels abrupt and slightly out of place. A smoother transition could be achieved by rephrasing to connect it more logically with the previous sentence about the grill. For example, ""...Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can put a gas grill on the deck for grilling steaks.)

""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.

""Baiklah,"" jawabku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""

""Tentu,"" katanya sambil meneguk bir.

Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga. Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya. Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga. Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak.""

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, focusing on details of the house's features. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its amenities. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that affect its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Off the beaten road"" implies remoteness and a sense of seclusion, not just distance from crowds. A better translation would be something like ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a remote location).

2.  **""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya""**: The phrase ""real log cabin"" is translated as ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya."" While understandable, it's slightly redundant. ""Sebenarnya"" (actually/really) isn't necessary and makes the sentence clunky. A more natural translation would be ""pondok kayu asli"" (authentic log cabin) or ""pondok kayu yang sesungguhnya"" (the true log cabin).

3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it."" It's grammatically correct but sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A more idiomatic translation would be ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) or ""di sebelah kamar mandi"" (next to the bathroom).

4.  **Repetitive use of ""akan ada""**: The phrase ""akan ada"" (there will be) is repeated multiple times, making the text sound monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Akan ada dapur di sini..."", consider ""Dapur akan berada di sini..."" or ""Di sini ada dapur..."".

5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and doesn't fit the conversational tone. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural expression like ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply implied.

6. **""Untuk steak.""**: This feels abrupt and slightly out of place. A smoother transition could be achieved by rephrasing to connect it more logically with the previous sentence about the grill. For example, ""...Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can put a gas grill on the deck for grilling steaks.)

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The issues primarily lie in unnatural phrasing and overly literal translations that detract from the conversational tone and flow of the original text. Specifically, the phrases ""jauh dari keramaian,"" ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya,"" ""tepat di sampingnya,"" and ""lihat?"" need to be rephrased to sound more natural in Indonesian while preserving the intended meaning. The repetition of ""akan ada"" also contributes to a less engaging reading experience.

3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it."" It's grammatically correct but sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A more idiomatic translation would be ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) or ""di sebelah kamar mandi"" (next to the bathroom).

4.  **Repetitive use of ""akan ada""**: The phrase ""akan ada"" (there will be) is repeated multiple times, making the text sound monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Akan ada dapur di sini..."", consider ""Dapur akan berada di sini..."" or ""Di sini ada dapur..."".

5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and doesn't fit the conversational tone. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural expression like ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply implied.

6. **""Untuk steak.""**: This feels abrupt and slightly out of place. A smoother transition could be achieved by rephrasing to connect it more logically with the previous sentence about the grill. For example, ""...Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can put a gas grill on the deck for grilling steaks.)

The translation needs revision. The issues primarily lie in unnatural phrasing and overly literal translations that detract from the conversational tone and flow of the original text. Specifically, the phrases ""jauh dari keramaian,"" ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya,"" ""tepat di sampingnya,"" and ""lihat?"" need to be rephrased to sound more natural in Indonesian while preserving the intended meaning. The repetition of ""akan ada"" also contributes to a less engaging reading experience.

--- FINAL TASK ---

--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, focusing on details of the house's features. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its amenities. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that affect its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Off the beaten road"" implies remoteness and a sense of seclusion, not just distance from crowds. A better translation would be something like ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a remote location).

2.  **""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya""**: The phrase ""real log cabin"" is translated as ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya."" While understandable, it's slightly redundant. ""Sebenarnya"" (actually/really) isn't necessary and makes the sentence clunky. A more natural translation would be ""pondok kayu asli"" (authentic log cabin) or ""pondok kayu yang sesungguhnya"" (the true log cabin).

""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian.
