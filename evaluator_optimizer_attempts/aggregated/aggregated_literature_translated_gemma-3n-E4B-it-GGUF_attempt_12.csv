1,"*Suicide, my ass*, was my instant, and silent, reaction. Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie? Of course this boy hadn't shot himself. Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend. I opened my eyes. Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing. I looked into the intent face of the deputy. ""No suicide here,"" I said.","*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*, itu reaksi instan dan terdiam saya. Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie? Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri. Dell Teague telah dibunuh, sama seperti pacar liar mereka. Saya membuka mata. Hollis Boxleitner sudah berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan. Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu. ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku.

The source text is a short, terse passage from a mystery or thriller novel. It conveys a sense of surprise and disbelief at the apparent suicide of a young boy, Dell Teague. The narrator, a deputy, is sent to investigate the scene instead of Sybil, who sent him to find Teenie. The deputy quickly dismisses the suicide claim, stating ""No suicide here,"" as the boy's death appears to be murder, similar to Dell Teague's murder and his girlfriend's reckless behavior. The tone is straightforward, matter-of-fact, and slightly sarcastic, with a hint of impatience at Sybil's inefficiency in handling the case.
