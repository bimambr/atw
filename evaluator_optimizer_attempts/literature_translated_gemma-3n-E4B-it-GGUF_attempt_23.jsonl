        "feedback": "--- EVALUATION ---\n\n**Clause-by-clause/Phrase-by-phrase Analysis:**\n\n*   \"Suicide, my ass\" -> \"Bunuh diri, omong kosong\" - This is a fairly direct and natural translation. \"Omong kosong\" effectively captures the dismissive and sarcastic tone of \"my ass.\"\n*   \"was my instant, and silent, reaction\" -> \"itu reaksi instan, dan terdiam, saya rasakan.\" - The translation is accurate but slightly clunky. \"Saya rasakan\" is a bit awkward. A better phrasing might be \"Itu reaksi instan yang terdiam, langsung terasa.\" or \"Reaksi instan yang terdiam, langsung saya rasakan.\"\n*   \"Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?\" -> \"Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya terlebih dahulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\" - This is a largely accurate translation, but the sentence structure feels a bit stiff in Indonesian. \"Makamnya terlebih dahulu\" is grammatically correct but could be smoother. \"Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makam *Dell* terlebih dahulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\" would improve clarity.\n*   \"Of course this boy hadn't shot himself.\" -> \"Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri.\" - Accurate and natural.\n*   \"Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend.\" -> \"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti kekasihnya yang pemberontak.\" - Accurate and natural.\n*   \"I opened my eyes.\" -> \"Saya membuka mata.\" - Simple and accurate.\n*   \"Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing.\" -> \"Hollis Boxleitner berputar untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan.\" - Accurate, but \"berputar\" might sound a little formal. \"Hollis Boxleitner berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan\" is a more natural alternative.\n*   \"I looked into the intent face of the deputy.\" -> \"Saya menatap wajah serius petugas polisi itu.\" - \"Serius\" is a good translation for \"intent\" in this context. \"Petugas polisi itu\" is a clear and accurate way to say \"the deputy.\"\n*   \"No suicide here,\" I said. -> \"Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" kataku. - Accurate and natural.\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, it lacks a certain fluency and naturalness. Some phrases feel a bit literal and could be improved for a more idiomatic Indonesian reading experience. The sentence structure in some parts is a little stiff. The overall tone is maintained, but the nuances of the original English are not always perfectly captured.\n\n**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**\n\n*   The use of \"terdiam\" in \"reaksi instan yang terdiam\" is a bit redundant.\n*   Consider rephrasing sentences to improve flow and avoid overly literal translations.\n*   Pay attention to sentence structure to make it sound more natural in Indonesian.\n*   While \"petugas polisi itu\" is correct, consider if a more concise phrasing is possible without losing meaning.\n\n\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

This improves the flow.\n2.  **Word Choice:** Consider alternatives to \"membaca makamnya\" (read his grave) which might sound more natural, such as \"mengecek makamnya\" (check his grave) or \"mengunjungi makamnya\" (visit his grave), depending on the desired nuance.\n3.  **Placement of Pronouns:** In sentences like \"itu adalah reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya,\" consider placing \"saya\" closer to the verb: \"Saya merasakan reaksi instan, dan sunyi.\" (I felt an instant, silent reaction.)\n4.  **Tone:** While \"omong kosong\" is good, ensure the overall tone remains consistent with the original's sarcastic and slightly cynical voice.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

The flow is natural, and the Indonesian reads well. The use of vocabulary is appropriate for the tone of the novel excerpt.\n\n**Issues and Suggestions:**\n\n*   While \"kesadaranku\" is accurate for \"my quick,\" it might benefit from a slightly more evocative phrase to capture the nuance of cleverness or quick wit. Consider \"kecerdasanku\" (my intelligence) or \"cerdikku\" (my cleverness), although these might slightly alter the original meaning. However, \"kesadaranku\" is perfectly acceptable.\n*   The repetition of \"aku\" (I) could be slightly varied for a more natural flow, although it's not strictly necessary.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\npass",

        "feedback": "--- EVALUATION ---\n\n**Clause-by-clause/Phrase-by-phrase Analysis:**\n\n*   **\"Tell me about your dream house,\" Hollis said, smiling.** - This is a straightforward sentence. The translation is accurate and natural.\n*   **\"Okay,\" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often.** - \"Okay\" translates well to \"Baiklah.\" \"Slowly\" is accurately rendered as \"perlahan.\" The phrase \"didn't talk about too often\" is well translated as \"jarang sekali ku bicarakan.\"\n*   **\"It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.\"** - This is a complex sentence with several clauses. The translation is generally accurate, but the phrasing could be smoother. \"Off the beaten road\" is well translated as \"di tempat yang terpencil.\" \"Inconveniences\" is accurately rendered as \"ketidaknyamanan.\" \"Alter it a little\" is fine, but could be slightly more natural.\n*   **\"Of course,\" he said, taking a sip of beer.** - \"Of course\" translates well to \"Tentu saja.\" \"Taking a sip of beer\" is accurately rendered as \"menyesap bir.\"\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, it lacks a certain fluency and naturalness. The sentence structure in the translated version is a bit clunky in places. The use of \"ku\" (a contraction of \"saya\" - I) is appropriate for informal speech, which fits the tone of the excerpt. However, the overall flow could be improved with some minor adjustments.\n\n**Specific Issues and Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **\"It will have to be off the beaten road...\"** - While \"di tempat yang terpencil\" is accurate, it's a bit literal. A more idiomatic translation could be \"Harus berada di lokasi yang terpencil...\" (Must be in a remote location...) or \"Aku ingin rumah itu berada jauh dari keramaian...\" (I want the house to be far from the crowds...).\n2.  **\"...but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin.\"** - This is grammatically correct, but a more natural phrasing would be \"...tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu yang asli.\" (...but without the problems usually found in a real log cabin.)\n3.  **\"I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it.\"** - This is fine, but could be slightly more concise: \"Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet dan membelinya.\" (I found the plans online and bought them.)\n4.  **\"But of course, I want to alter it a little.\"** - \"Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit\" is correct, but consider \"Namun, aku ingin sedikit memodifikasinya.\" (However, I want to modify it a little.) \"Memodifikasi\" sounds slightly more natural in this context.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

A more natural phrasing might be \"Sambil menatap meja, aku menggambar dengan jari.\" (While looking at the table, I drew with my finger.)\n*   **\"Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet.\" -> \"Di belakang rumah, akan ada teras untuk mobil, jadi Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.\"** As noted in the context, \"*porte cochere*\" is not a common term in Indonesian. Translating it as \"teras untuk mobil\" (car portico) is a poor choice and changes the meaning. A better approach would be to use a descriptive phrase like \"tempat berteduh untuk mobil\" (shelter for cars) or \"area parkir tertutup\" (covered parking area), depending on the desired level of formality. The phrase \"tanpa basah-basah\" (without getting wet) is a bit informal and could be replaced with a more elegant phrasing like \"tanpa perlu terkena hujan\" (without needing to be exposed to rain).\n*   **\"There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room.\" -> \"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga.\"** The use of \"tahu?\" (you know?) is a direct translation of \"see?\" and works, but it can sound a bit unnatural. A more natural alternative would be \"atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga.\" (or maybe I will place it next to the family room.)\n*   **\"That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.\" -> \"Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan Anda bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.\"** This is a relatively accurate translation, but the repetition of \"Anda bisa\" (you can) is a bit monotonous. It could be rephrased to improve the flow.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate translation of \"porte cochere\":** This is a major error that significantly alters the meaning.\n*   **Awkward phrasing:** Some sentences are overly literal and lack natural flow.\n*   **Repetitive sentence structure:** The frequent use of \"Anda bisa\" makes the text sound monotonous.\n*   **Misplaced information:** The initial phrase about the car portico is incorrectly placed.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

        "feedback": "--- EVALUATION ---\n\n**Overall Coherence:** The revised translation is significantly improved. It addresses the previous issues of unnatural phrasing, repetitive sentence structure, and the inaccurate translation of \"porte cochere.\" The flow is much smoother and the Indonesian reads more naturally.\n\n**Clause-by-Clause Analysis:**\n\n*   **\"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.\" -> \"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.\"** Accurate and maintains the original meaning.\n*   **\"Di belakang rumah, akan ada area parkir tertutup untuk mobil, sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa perlu terkena hujan.\" -> \"Di belakang rumah, akan ada area parkir tertutup untuk mobil, sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa perlu terkena hujan.\"** The translation of \"porte cochere\" as \"area parkir tertutup untuk mobil\" (covered parking area for cars) is a much better and more accurate choice. \"Tanpa perlu terkena hujan\" (without needing to be exposed to rain) is a more natural and elegant way of saying \"without getting wet.\"\n*   **\"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga.\" -> \"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga.\"** This is a good translation and maintains the original meaning.\n*   **\"Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan Anda bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.\" -> \"Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan Anda bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.\"** Accurate and maintains the original meaning. The repetition of \"Anda bisa\" is still present, but it's less jarring than in the previous version.\n\n**Specific Improvements:**\n\n*   **Accurate translation of \"porte cochere\":** The use of \"area parkir tertutup untuk mobil\" is a significant improvement.\n*   **Improved flow and naturalness:** The revised sentences read more smoothly and naturally in Indonesian.\n*   **More elegant phrasing:** The use of \"tanpa perlu terkena hujan\" is a more sophisticated way of expressing the idea of avoiding getting wet.\n\n**Remaining Minor Issues:**\n\n*   The repetition of \"Anda bisa\" could be further improved with more varied sentence structures. However, it's not a critical error.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\npass",
