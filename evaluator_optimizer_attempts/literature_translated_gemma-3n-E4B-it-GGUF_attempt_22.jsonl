The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech.

        "feedback": "--- EVALUATION ---\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe source text uses informal language (\"my ass,\" \"omong kosong\") and a direct, slightly cynical tone characteristic of the narrator, Harper Connelly. The phrasing is concise and to the point, reflecting her pragmatic and somewhat jaded personality. The context establishes Harper's unusual profession and her tendency to be underestimated. The reference to Sybil Teague and Dell Teague requires careful handling to maintain clarity and avoid ambiguity. The key is to convey the immediacy and frustration of Harper's internal monologue.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and naturalness of the original.\n\n*   **\"Suicide, my ass\"**: \"Bunuh diri, omong kosong\" is a very literal translation. While understandable, it sounds somewhat unnatural in Indonesian. Alternatives:\n    *   \"Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.\" (Suicide? Don't be foolish.) - More idiomatic and conveys the disbelief.\n    *   \"Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.\" (Suicide? Impossible.) - Slightly less informal, but still conveys skepticism.\n    *   \"Bunuh diri? Mana mungkin.\" (Suicide? How could it be?) - More colloquial and fits the tone better.\n\n*   **\"Why hadn't Sybil hired me...\"**: \"Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya...\" is grammatically correct but a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be:\n    *   \"Kenapa Sybil tidak memanggil saya untuk...\" (Why didn't Sybil call me to...) - \"Memanggil\" is more natural than \"mempekerjakan\" in this context.\n    *   \"Kenapa Sybil tidak meminta saya untuk...\" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to...) - Similar to the above, \"meminta\" fits better.\n\n*   **\"intent face of the deputy\"**: \"wajah serius petugas kepolisian itu\" is accurate, but \"serius\" (serious) is a bit bland. Alternatives:\n    *   \"wajah tegang petugas kepolisian itu\" (tense face of the police officer) - Captures a sense of alertness and suspicion.\n    *   \"wajah khawatiran petugas kepolisian itu\" (worried face of the police officer) - Conveys a sense of concern.\n\n*   **Overall Coherence**: The translation is understandable, but the flow feels slightly clunky in places. The sentence structure could be adjusted to better match Indonesian sentence patterns and create a more natural reading experience. The use of \"itu\" (that/the) is slightly overused and can be removed in some instances.\n\nThe translation correctly implements the analysis by addressing the informal language and the need for a direct tone. However, it could be improved by adopting more idiomatic expressions and refining sentence structure for a smoother, more natural flow.\n\n\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

The sentence structure is more idiomatic, and the overall impact is more consistent with the original's tone. The removal of unnecessary \"itu\" further enhances the flow.\n\nThe revised translation successfully addresses the previous feedback by adopting more idiomatic expressions and refining sentence structure to create a more natural and impactful reading experience.

The flow is natural, and the Indonesian reads smoothly. The translator has successfully captured the informal and somewhat cynical tone of the original English. There are no glaring errors or awkward phrasings.\n\n**Suggestions/Alternatives:**\n\n*   While \"omong kosong\" is good, \"pura-pura bunuh diri\" (pretending to commit suicide) could also be used to emphasize the narrator's disbelief. However, \"omong kosong\" is a more concise and impactful choice.\n*   \"Berbalik\" is a good translation for \"swung around,\" but depending on the context, \"memalingkan badan\" (turning one's body) could also be considered, though it might sound slightly more formal.\n*   The choice of \"petugas polisi itu\" is perfectly acceptable.

        "feedback": "--- EVALUATION ---\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe source text uses informal language (\"confidence trickster,\" \"impugn our honor\") to convey Harper's annoyance and Tolliver's sensitivity. The tone is somewhat cynical and self-deprecating, highlighting the negative perception Harper and Tolliver face. The phrase \"getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast\" is a key stylistic element, emphasizing the efficiency and transactional nature of their work. A key element is the contrast between the urgency felt by the living and the timelessness of the dead.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and doesn't fully capture the original's tone and stylistic choices.\n\n*   **\"Penipu ulung\" (confidence trickster):** While a literal translation, it feels a bit too strong and lacks the subtle sarcasm implied in \"confidence trickster.\" Alternatives: \"seolah-olah penipu\" (as if a trickster), or \"seperti orang yang mencoba menipu\" (like someone trying to deceive).\n*   **\"Memanfaatkan keahlianku\" (exploit my skills):** This is a rather literal translation of \"let them touch my quick.\" The original idiom implies a vulnerability being exploited; this translation is too clinical. Better options: \"membiarkan mereka mengambil keuntungan dariku\" (let them take advantage of me), or \"tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kelemahan saya\" (not letting them exploit my weakness). The original phrasing suggests a more personal and potentially physical vulnerability.\n*   **\"Kurang berhasil\" (less successful):** This is a very plain way of saying \"less successful.\" It lacks the slightly sharper tone of the original. Alternatives: \"tidak sehandal itu\" (not as skilled), or \"tidak secepat itu\" (not as quick).\n*   **\"Mencemarkan nama baik kami\" (defame our honor):** This is accurate but sounds a bit formal and literary in Indonesian, clashing with the overall tone of the passage. A more natural phrasing would be: \"mengkritik kami\" (criticize us), or \"menuduh kami melakukan kesalahan\" (accuse us of making mistakes). The original's phrasing is more about a feeling of personal affront than a formal defamation.\n*   **Overall Coherence:** The translation is understandable, but the sentence flow isn't as smooth or impactful as the original. It lacks the punchiness of the original phrases. The translation feels somewhat stiff and doesn't quite capture the conversational tone. The use of \"kami\" (us) feels slightly odd, as if referring to a professional identity rather than a personal one.\n\nThe translation correctly identifies the main points of the text, but the word choices and phrasing could be more evocative and natural.

The tone is somewhat cynical and self-deprecating, highlighting the negative perception Harper and Tolliver face. The phrase \"getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast\" is a key stylistic element, emphasizing the efficiency and transactional nature of their work. A key element is the contrast between the urgency felt by the living and the timelessness of the dead.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe revised translation is a significant improvement. It addresses the issues raised in the previous evaluation and more accurately captures the original's tone and style.\n\n*   **\"Orang yang mencoba menipu\" (someone trying to deceive):** This is a better alternative to \"penipu ulung\" as it conveys the intended meaning without being overly strong or sarcastic.\n*   **\"Tidak membiarkan mereka mengambil keuntungan dariku\" (not letting them take advantage of me):** This is a much stronger and more accurate translation of \"let them touch my quick,\" capturing the sense of vulnerability and exploitation.\n*   **\"Tidak sehandal itu\" (not as skilled):** This is a more natural and less formal way of saying \"less successful\" than the previous translation. It maintains a similar level of informality.\n*   **\"Mengkritik kami\" (criticize us):** This is a better and more natural alternative to \"mencemarkan nama baik kami,\" avoiding the overly formal tone of the previous attempt.\n*   **Overall Coherence:** The revised translation flows much more smoothly and feels more natural in Indonesian. The word choices are more evocative and better reflect the original's conversational tone. The use of \"kami\" (us) feels more appropriate in this context, referring to their shared profession and experience. The revised version successfully maintains the cynical and self-deprecating tone of the original.\n\nThe revised translation successfully balances accuracy with stylistic fidelity, resulting in a more compelling and natural-sounding Indonesian version.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\npass",

The tone is somewhat cynical and slightly humorous. The key is capturing Harper's internal state of defensiveness and Tolliver's pride. The phrase \"getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast\" highlights Harper's efficiency and pragmatic approach to her unusual profession.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness.\n\n*   **\"penipu ulung\"**: While \"penipu ulung\" translates to \"skilled swindler,\" it's a bit too strong. \"Penipu\" (swindler) is accurate but doesn't quite capture the subtle annoyance Harper feels. A better option would be \"orang yang memanfaatkan kepercayaan orang lain\" (someone who exploits people's trust) which is more descriptive and less judgmental.\n*   **\"memanfaatkan kecerdikan saya\"**: This translates to \"exploit my cleverness.\" While technically correct, it's not idiomatic. A more natural phrasing would be \"memainkan kecerdikanku\" (play with my cleverness) or \"memanfaatkan kepintaranku\" (exploit my intelligence).\n*   **\"kurang berhasil\"**: This is a straightforward translation of \"less successful\" and is grammatically correct, but lacks the subtle implication of Tolliver's strong reaction. Something like \"tidak sekuat saya\" (not as strong as I am) might better convey the idea of him being less adept at protecting their reputation.\n*   **\"mencemarkan nama baik kami\"**: This is a standard translation of \"impugn our honor\" and is acceptable. However, it's a bit formal and could be made more impactful. \"Menghina reputasi kami\" (insult our reputation) might be a stronger choice, depending on the desired tone.\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is understandable, but it feels somewhat stiff and lacks the sharpness of the original. The phrasing is a bit too literal in places, which diminishes the impact of Harper's personality and Tolliver's reaction.

The tone is light and conversational, with a hint of introspection from the speaker, Hollis. The style is straightforward and descriptive, focusing on details of a dream house. The challenge lies in conveying the natural flow of dialogue and the subtle nuances of the language in Indonesian. The phrase \"off the beaten road\" needs a natural equivalent that captures the meaning of being secluded or remote. The slightly formal \"alter it a little\" requires a phrase that sounds natural in Indonesian while retaining the sense of minor modifications.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but lacks subtlety and naturalness in places.\n\n*   **\"Tell me about your dream house,\" Hollis said, smiling.** - This is a good, direct translation and accurate.\n*   **\"Okay,\" I said, slowly.

Consider varying the phrasing or omitting it where possible.\n*   The phrasing \"mengubahnya sedikit\" (\"to change it a little\") is a bit too formal and lacks nuance. Consider using something like \"memodifikasinya\" (to modify it) or \"memberi sentuhan pribadi\" (to add a personal touch) depending on the desired tone.\n*   The sentence structure in the Indonesian translation is a bit too literal, making it sound slightly unnatural. Rephrasing certain parts can improve the flow and readability.\n\nOverall, the translation is understandable, but it lacks the naturalness and stylistic flair of a native speaker.

This was something I didn't talk about too often.** - \"Baiklah,\" jawabku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku bicarakan.  \"Baiklah\" is a suitable translation for \"Okay.\" \"Perlahan\" effectively conveys \"slowly.\" \"Yang jarang sekali ku bicarakan\" accurately captures the nuance of \"didn't talk about too often.\"\n\n*   **\"It will have to be off the beaten road, of course.

Aku ingin tampilannya seperti kabin kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan membelinya.

A more natural phrasing might be \"tanpa masalah yang biasa ada di kabin kayu.\"  \"Rancangannya di internet\" is correct, but \"desainnya\" could be a slightly more elegant alternative. \"Mengubahnya sedikit\" is accurate, but could be more emphatic, such as \"mengubahnya sedikit saja\" (to change it just a little).\n\n*   **\"Of course,\" he said, taking a sip of beer.** - \"Tentu,\" katanya, sambil menyesap bir.  This is a perfect translation.\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is generally coherent and understandable. The word choices are appropriate, and the sentence structure is natural. However, the translation leans towards a more literal translation, which sometimes results in slightly awkward phrasing. There's room for improvement in making the Indonesian flow more smoothly and sound more idiomatic. The repetition of \"Tentu saja\" (Of course) could be slightly adjusted for a more natural feel, perhaps by varying the phrasing or omitting it in some instances.\n\n**Specific Issues & Suggestions:**\n\n*   **\"Ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya\"**: Consider \"tanpa masalah yang biasa ada di kabin kayu\" or \"tanpa kekurangan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya.\"\n*   **\"Rancangannya di internet\"**: Consider \"desainnya di internet\".\n*   **Repetition of \"Tentu saja\"**: In the full text, consider varying the phrasing or removing it where appropriate.\n\n\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

However, the sentence structure is a bit awkward.  \"langsung ke dapur\" is slightly redundant; \"ke dapur\" is sufficient.  The \"tanpa basah\" is grammatically correct but sounds a little stiff. \"agar tidak kebasahan\" would be more natural, although a bit formal.\n*   **\"There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see?

Replacing it with \"kamu\" (you - informal) where appropriate would improve the flow and conversational feel.\n*   **Redundancy:** Avoid unnecessary repetition.\n*   **Stilted Phrasing:**  Rephrase sentences to sound more natural and less literal.\n*   **\"Porte Cochere\":** While retaining the term is correct, a brief explanation or a more descriptive phrase in parentheses might be helpful for readers unfamiliar with the term, especially in the first instance. e.g., \"porte cochere (tempat parkir mobil yang tertutup)\".\n\n\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

        "feedback": "--- EVALUATION ---\n\n**Overall Coherence:** The translation is generally understandable, but lacks natural flow and precision. It reads somewhat awkwardly and doesn't fully capture the conversational tone of the original. The use of \"tahu?\" (know?) is a bit informal and doesn't quite fit the narrator's voice.\n\n**Clause-by-Clause/Phrase-by-Phrase Breakdown:**\n\n*   \"It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room.\" - \"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.\" - This is a direct and accurate translation. No issues.\n*   \"There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it.\" - \"Ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya.\" - Accurate, but \"tepat di sebelahnya\" is a bit formal. \"Berdekatan dengan\" or \"di sampingnya\" might sound more natural.\n*   \"I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger.\" - \"Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jari.\" - Accurate and natural.\n*   \"Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet.\" - \"Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah kuyup.\" - The term *porte cochere* is retained, which is correct. However, the explanation is a bit clunky. Consider: \"Di bagian belakang, ada sebuah *porte cochere* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan.\" or \"Di bagian belakang, ada sebuah *porte cochere* yang memungkinkan kamu membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.\"\n*   \"There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see?\" - \"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?\" - \"Tahu?\" is too informal. Alternatives: \"Tidak?\" (right?), \"Lihat?\" (see?), or simply omitting the tag question altogether: \"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur.\"\n*   \"Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.\" - \"Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di ruang keluarga. Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak.\" - This section is mostly accurate. \"Menempatkannya\" is a bit vague. Consider \"meletakkannya\" or \"membangunnya,\" depending on the context. Also, the repetition of \"Dan kamu bisa...\" feels slightly repetitive. A more concise phrasing would be preferable.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n\n*   The use of \"tahu?\" is too informal and disrupts the tone.\n*   The explanation of *porte cochere* is a bit wordy.\n*   Some sentences are slightly repetitive.\n*   The overall flow could be improved with more varied sentence structures.\n\nThe translation is functional but lacks stylistic finesse. It needs polishing to sound more natural and engaging in Indonesian.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",
