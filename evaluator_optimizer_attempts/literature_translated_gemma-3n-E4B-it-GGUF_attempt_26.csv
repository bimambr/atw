Harper is a unique professional who helps people find the last moments of the deceased, offering closure to the living. She's traveling with her step-brother, Tolliver, who acts as her manager and protector. Upon arriving at the scene, Harper immediately dismisses the initial assumption of suicide, realizing that Dell Teague, the boyfriend of Sybil Teague's son (Teenie), was murdered, just like Teenie himself. She confirms this to Deputy Hollis Boxleitner.

<translation>
Reaksi instan, dalam hati saya, adalah *bunuh diri, omong kosong*. Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie? Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri. Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar liarnya. Saya membuka mata. Hollis Boxleitner berputar untuk melihat apa yang sedang saya lakukan. Saya menatap wajah serius petugas polisi itu. ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku.
</translation>","<analysis>
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. The tone of the original text, which is cynical and slightly sarcastic, is maintained in the Indonesian translation. The use of ""omong kosong"" for ""my ass"" is a fairly direct and acceptable equivalent, capturing the informal and dismissive tone. The sentence structure is mostly natural in Indonesian, although there are a few minor awkward phrasings. The word ""serius"" (serious) is used to describe the deputy's face, which is a reasonable interpretation of ""intent.""
</analysis>
<evaluation>
The translation is quite good and largely successful. However, there are a few areas for improvement.

1.  **""dalam hati saya""**: While grammatically correct, it's a bit redundant. ""Dalam hati"" (in my heart) is implied. Consider removing it for a more natural flow.
2.  **""membaca makamnya terlebih dahulu""**: This is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing might be ""membaca naskah kematiannya terlebih dahulu"" (reading his death record first) or ""memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu"" (checking his grave first).
3.  **""petugas polisi itu""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Petugas itu"" (that officer) would be more natural.

Here are some alternative suggestions:

*   ""Reaksi instan saya adalah *bunuh diri, omong kosong*."" (Removing ""dalam hati saya"")
*   ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca naskah kematiannya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Replacing ""makamnya"" with ""naskah kematiannya"")
*   ""Saya menatap wajah petugas itu."" (Replacing ""petugas polisi itu"" with ""petugas itu"")

“Baiklah,” jawabku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. “Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.”

“Tentu,” katanya, sambil menyesap bir.</translation>","<analysis>The translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, there are a few areas where the Indonesian feels slightly unnatural and could be improved for a more fluid reading experience. The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" (Of course) feels a bit clunky. While grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance of the original English. The phrase ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the actual inconveniences of a real log cabin) is a bit wordy and could be simplified. The overall tone is preserved, but the phrasing could be more idiomatic.</analysis>
<evaluation>The translation is mostly good, but needs refinement. Here's a breakdown:

*   **""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu""**: Accurate and natural.
*   **""Baiklah, jawabku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan.""**:  ""Perlahan"" (slowly) is a bit redundant after ""jawabku"" (I answered). Consider removing it. ""Jarang sekali aku bicarakan"" is fine, but could be slightly more natural as ""jarang aku membicarakannya"" (rarely do I talk about it).
*   **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama.""**: The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is a little awkward. Consider replacing it with something like ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang terpencil."" (Of course, the house must be in a secluded place.)
*   **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya.""**: This is wordy. A better option would be: ""Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kerumitan pondok kayu."" (I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the complexities of a log cabin.)
*   **""Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya.""**: Accurate.
*   **""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""**: Again, the repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is a bit clunky. Consider ""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin sedikit mengubahnya."" (But of course, I want to change it a little.)
*   **""Tentu, katanya, sambil menyesap bir.""**: Accurate.

**Suggestions:**

1.  Replace the repeated ""Tentu saja"" with alternatives like ""Tentu saja,"" ""Memang,"" or rephrase the sentence to avoid the repetition.
2.  Simplify the phrasing in the sentence about the inconveniences of a log cabin.
3.  Consider ""jarang aku membicarakannya"" instead of ""jarang sekali aku bicarakan.""
4.  Replace ""sambil menyesap bir"" with ""sambil minum bir"" for a more natural flow, although ""menyesap"" isn't incorrect.

    <item>Novel synopsis: The narrator, Harper Connelly, has what you might call a strange job: she finds dead people. She can sense the final location of a person who's passed, and share their very last moment. The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent - even if the dead can wait forever.</item>

<source_text>""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer.</source_text>
<evaluation><analysis>The translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, there are a few areas where the Indonesian feels slightly unnatural and could be improved for a more fluid reading experience. The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" (Of course) feels a bit clunky. While grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance of the original English. The phrase ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the actual inconveniences of a real log cabin) is a bit wordy and could be simplified. The overall tone is preserved, but the phrasing could be more idiomatic.</analysis>
<evaluation>The translation is mostly good, but needs refinement. Here's a breakdown:

*   **""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu""**: Accurate and natural.
*   **""Baiklah, jawabku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan.""**:  ""Perlahan"" (slowly) is a bit redundant after ""jawabku"" (I answered). Consider removing it. ""Jarang sekali aku bicarakan"" is fine, but could be slightly more natural as ""jarang aku membicarakannya"" (rarely do I talk about it).
*   **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama.""**: The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is a little awkward. Consider replacing it with something like ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang terpencil."" (Of course, the house must be in a secluded place.)
*   **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya.""**: This is wordy. A better option would be: ""Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kerumitan pondok kayu."" (I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the complexities of a log cabin.)
*   **""Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya.""**: Accurate.
*   **""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""**: Again, the repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is a bit clunky. Consider ""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin sedikit mengubahnya."" (But of course, I want to change it a little.)
*   **""Tentu, katanya, sambil menyesap bir.""**: Accurate.

**Suggestions:**

1.  Replace the repeated ""Tentu saja"" with alternatives like ""Tentu saja,"" ""Memang,"" or rephrase the sentence to avoid the repetition.
2.  Simplify the phrasing in the sentence about the inconveniences of a log cabin.
3.  Consider ""jarang aku membicarakannya"" instead of ""jarang sekali aku bicarakan.""
4.  Replace ""sambil menyesap bir"" with ""sambil minum bir"" for a more natural flow, although ""menyesap"" isn't incorrect.

Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent - even if the dead can wait forever.</item>

<source_text>It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""</source_text>
<attempt>Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga. Dapur akan berada di sana, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya. Di bagian belakang, akan ada sebuah *area parkir tertutup* untuk mobil, agar Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, atau mungkin di sisi ruang keluarga. Di sana akan ada perapian, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Anda juga bisa meletakkan kompor gas di teras itu, untuk memanggang steak.</attempt>
