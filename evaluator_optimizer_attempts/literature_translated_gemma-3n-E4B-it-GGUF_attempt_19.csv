The source text uses informal, almost slang-like language (""Suicide, my ass""). This conveys the narrator's cynicism, impatience, and perhaps a touch of disrespect. The tone is sharp and direct. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong, emphatic denial. The sentence structure is relatively simple and direct, reflecting a conversational style. The cultural reference is the common idiom ""Suicide, my ass,"" which is a very direct and dismissive way of rejecting the idea of suicide. The text relies on a slightly cynical and world-weary voice.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and informality of the original. Here's a breakdown:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"", itu reaksi instan, dan terdiam, saya rasakan. - While ""Omong kosong"" translates to ""nonsense,"" it's a bit too mild. It doesn't capture the dismissive, almost aggressive tone of ""Suicide, my ass."" ""Reaksi instan, dan terdiam, saya rasakan"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat stiff and unnatural. The ""terdiam"" (silent) is redundant since the sentence already implies a silent reaction.
*   Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie? - This part is mostly accurate, but the phrasing is a little clunky. ""Mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu"" (visit his grave first) is correct, but the overall sentence structure feels a bit formal for the context.
*   Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri. - This is a direct and accurate translation.
*   Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacarnya yang liar. - Accurate and natural.
*   Saya membuka mata. Hollis Boxleitner telah berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan. - Accurate and natural.
*   Saya menatap wajah serius wakil. - Accurate and natural.
*   ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku. - Accurate and natural.

The translation is factually correct, but it doesn't fully capture the original's attitude. The language is too polite and lacks the necessary bite. The sentence structure is also somewhat formal, which doesn't match the informal tone of the source text.

--- VERDICT ---

fail

The translation needs to be more forceful and less formal. Here's how to improve:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Dasar bodoh!*"", itu reaksi instan, dan terdiam, saya rasakan. Instead of ""Omong kosong,"" consider a stronger, more dismissive phrase like ""Dasar bodoh!"" (You idiot!) or ""Tidak mungkin!"" (No way!). This better reflects the original's cynicism.
*   Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie? Could be rephrased to: ""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh gue lihat makamnya dulu, daripada dikirim ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" This uses more colloquial language (""nggak"" for ""tidak,"" ""gue"" for ""saya"") to match the informal tone.
*   Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri. - This is fine, but could be made more emphatic: ""Mana mungkin dia bunuh diri?"" (How could he have committed suicide?).
*   Saya menatap wajah serius wakil. - This is fine.
*   ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku. - This is fine.

The source text employs informal language (""Suicide, my ass"") to convey disbelief and cynicism. The tone is sarcastic and slightly world-weary. The style is direct and conversational, using short sentences and simple vocabulary. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong idiom expressing disbelief. The reference to ""reading his grave"" implies a detective or someone accustomed to investigating deaths. The use of ""wild girlfriend"" suggests a somewhat scandalous or unconventional relationship. The overall meaning is that the narrator is immediately skeptical of the apparent cause of death, which is being presented as suicide.

1.  ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*, itu adalah reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya."" - While ""Omong kosong"" is a valid translation of ""bullshit,"" it's a bit too strong and direct for the tone. It lacks the sarcastic bite of ""my ass."" ""Reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat awkward. A more natural phrasing would be needed.

4.  ""Dell Teague telah dibunuh, sama seperti pacar liar dirinya."" - ""Pacar liar dirinya"" is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural. It's better to say ""pacar liar Dell Teague"" or ""pacar Dell Teague yang terkenal.""
5.  ""Saya membuka mata."" - This is a perfectly acceptable translation, but it's a bit bland.
6.  ""Hollis Boxleitner telah berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan."" - This is a correct translation, but ""melihat apa yang saya lakukan"" is a bit verbose. ""Melihat saya melakukan apa"" would be more concise and natural.
7.  ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil."" - This is a correct translation, but ""wakil"" is a formal term for deputy. Depending on the context, ""deputi"" might be more appropriate.

3.  Strengthen the disbelief in ""Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri"" to ""*Nggak mungkin dia bunuh diri.*"" or ""*Ah, nggak mungkin dia bunuh diri.*""
4.  Change ""pacar liar dirinya"" to ""pacar Dell Teague yang terkenal"" or ""pacar Dell Teague yang kontroversial"" to sound more natural.
5.  Replace ""Saya membuka mata"" with a more evocative phrase like ""Saya membuka mata dengan terkejut"" (I opened my eyes in surprise) or simply ""Saya membuka mata.""
6.  Shorten ""Hollis Boxleitner telah berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan"" to ""Hollis Boxleitner menoleh untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan.""

*Suicide, my ass*, was my instant, and silent, reaction. Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie? Of course this boy hadn't shot himself. Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend. I opened my eyes. Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing. I looked into the intent face of the deputy. ""No suicide here,"" I said.

The source text conveys a sense of vulnerability and defensiveness. The speaker feels unfairly accused (""treated like a confidence trickster"") and is actively protecting their inner self (""retreat inside myself,"" ""don't let them touch my quick""). The phrase ""impugn our honor"" suggests a strong sense of pride and reputation, and that the accusations are deeply offensive. The tone is one of irritation and a hint of wounded pride. ""Quick"" in this context is slang for a person's wits, sensitivity, or emotional core. It's a very personal and vulnerable part of oneself. The cultural reference is the understanding of ""honor"" as a significant aspect of identity and social standing.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

1.  **""penipu ulung""**: While ""penipu ulung"" (a cunning swindler) is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster,"" it sounds somewhat formal and lacks the slightly informal, almost self-deprecating tone of the original. ""Penipu"" alone might be better, or perhaps a phrase that captures the feeling of being falsely accused of deception.
2.  **""menyentuh kesadaranku""**: ""Kesadaran"" translates to ""consciousness"" or ""awareness."" While technically correct, it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning of ""my quick."" ""Quick"" here refers to a person's sensitivity, wits, or emotional core – a vulnerable part of themselves. A better translation might be ""menyentuh inti diriku"" (touching my core) or ""menyentuh kepekaan/sensitivitasku"" (touching my sensitivity).
3.  **""kurang berhasil""**: This is a very literal and somewhat clunky translation of ""less successful."" It lacks the flow and naturalness of Indonesian. A more idiomatic translation would be ""tidak seberhasil itu"" (not as successful as that) or ""tidak berhasil dengan baik"" (not successful well).
4.  **""mencoreng kehormatan kami""**: ""Mencoreng"" means ""to stain"" or ""to tarnish."" While accurate, it's a bit strong. ""Impugn"" implies a more direct and deliberate attack on one's honor. A better option might be ""menuduh merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (accusing of belittling our honor) or ""menyerang reputasi kami"" (attacking our reputation).

The translation correctly identifies the core meaning of the sentences but fails to capture the subtle emotional nuances and the informal tone of the original. The phrasing is often too literal and lacks the natural flow of Indonesian.

--- VERDICT ---

The translation is a significant improvement, but still has room for refinement.

1. **""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu""**: This is a good start, capturing the essence of ""being treated like a confidence trickster."" However, it lacks the slightly more informal and self-deprecating tone of the original. ""Aku tidak suka *diperlakukan* seperti penipu"" might be a closer match.
2. **""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri""**: This is a perfectly acceptable translation of ""retreat inside myself.""
3. **""dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kepekaanku""**: ""Kepekaan"" is a good translation of ""quick"" in this context, conveying sensitivity and emotional vulnerability.
4. **""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil""**: This is a decent translation, but ""kurang berhasil"" is still a bit clunky. ""Tidak seberhasil itu"" or ""tidak berhasil dengan baik"" would be more natural.
5. **""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menuduh merendahkan kehormatan kami""**: ""Menuduh merendahkan kehormatan kami"" is a good attempt at translating ""impugn our honor."" However, it's still a bit formal. ""Menyerang reputasi kami"" (attacking our reputation) or ""merusak nama baik kami"" (damaging our good name) might be more impactful, depending on the desired nuance.

The source text conveys a sense of vulnerability and defensiveness. The speaker feels unfairly accused (""treated like a confidence trickster"") and is actively protecting themselves emotionally (""retreat inside myself,"" ""don't let them touch my quick""). The tone is somewhat cynical and emotionally charged. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities. ""Impugn our honor"" is a formal way of saying to attack or discredit someone's reputation. The overall meaning is that the speaker and Tolliver are sensitive about their reputation and are reacting defensively to perceived attacks.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but contains some awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural tone in Indonesian.

1.  **""penipu ulung""**: While ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster,"" it sounds a bit too strong and formal. It might imply a level of deception that isn't necessarily intended in the original. A more natural translation might be ""orang yang suka memanfaatkan orang lain"" (someone who likes to take advantage of others) or ""orang yang dianggap licik"" (someone considered cunning). The best choice depends on the specific nuance desired.

2.  **""menyentuh saraf saya""**: This translates ""touch my quick"" literally as ""touch my nerves."" While understandable, it doesn't quite capture the figurative meaning of being exploited or taking advantage of someone's vulnerabilities. A better translation would be ""memainkan emosi saya"" (playing on my emotions) or ""memanfaatkan kelemahan saya"" (exploiting my weaknesses).

3.  **""kurang berhasil""**: This is a perfectly acceptable translation of ""less successful,"" but it's a bit bland. It lacks the emotional weight of the original. Consider ""tidak seberhasil itu"" (not as successful as that) or ""tidak berhasil seperti yang mereka inginkan"" (didn't succeed as they wanted).

The analysis remains the same as the previous iteration. The core meaning revolves around the speaker's feeling of being unfairly accused and the emotional impact of that accusation. The figurative language (""touch my quick,"" ""impugn our honor"") adds layers of meaning related to vulnerability and reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is a direct application of the previous feedback, and it shows improvement. The replacements made are more natural and better capture the intended meaning.

1.  **""orang yang suka memanfaatkan orang lain""**: This is a solid improvement over ""penipu ulung."" It's less accusatory and more descriptive of the feeling of being taken advantage of.
2.  **""memanfaatkan kelemahan saya""**: This is a much better translation of ""touch my quick"" than ""menyentuh saraf saya."" It accurately conveys the idea of exploiting vulnerabilities.
3.  **""tidak seberhasil itu""**: This is a good, natural-sounding alternative to ""kurang berhasil.""
4.  **""menjelek-jelekkan reputasi kami""**: This is a suitable replacement for ""mencoreng kehormatan kami,"" offering a more conversational tone.

However, the repetition of ""tidak"" (not) in ""tidak seberhasil itu"" feels slightly clunky. While grammatically correct, it could be smoother.

--- VERDICT ---

The translation successfully addresses the previous feedback and provides a more natural and nuanced rendering of the original text in Indonesian.

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---

The source text conveys a sense of vulnerability and defensiveness. The speaker feels unfairly accused (""treated like a confidence trickster"") and is actively protecting themselves emotionally (""retreat inside myself,"" ""don't let them touch my quick""). The tone is somewhat cynical and emotionally charged. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities. ""Impugn our honor"" is a formal way of saying to attack or discredit someone's reputation. The overall meaning is that the speaker and Tolliver are sensitive about their reputation and are reacting defensively to perceived attacks.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but contains some awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural tone in Indonesian.

1.  **""penipu ulung""**: While ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster,"" it sounds a bit too strong and formal. It might imply a level of deception that isn't necessarily intended in the original. A more natural translation might be ""orang yang suka memanfaatkan orang lain"" (someone who likes to take advantage of others) or ""orang yang dianggap licik"" (someone considered cunning). The best choice depends on the specific nuance desired.

2.  **""menyentuh saraf saya""**: This translates ""touch my quick"" literally as ""touch my nerves."" While understandable, it doesn't quite capture the figurative meaning of being exploited or taking advantage of someone's vulnerabilities. A better translation would be ""memainkan emosi saya"" (playing on my emotions) or ""memanfaatkan kelemahan saya"" (exploiting my weaknesses).

3.  **""kurang berhasil""**: This is a perfectly acceptable translation of ""less successful,"" but it's a bit bland. It lacks the emotional weight of the original. Consider ""tidak seberhasil itu"" (not as successful as that) or ""tidak berhasil seperti yang mereka inginkan"" (didn't succeed as they wanted).

4.  **""mencoreng kehormatan kami""**: This is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's quite formal and might sound a bit stilted in Indonesian. A more natural alternative could be ""menjelek-jelekkan reputasi kami"" (badmouthing our reputation) or ""merusak nama baik kami"" (damaging our reputation).

The source text is a casual conversation snippet. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language. The meaning is clear and conveys a sense of intimacy and a slightly quirky personality in the speaker. The phrase ""off the beaten road"" implies a desire for seclusion and a unique location. The contrast between the aesthetic (log cabin) and practicalities (avoiding inconveniences) highlights a specific kind of desire – a romanticized ideal with a modern sensibility. The repetition of ""of course"" adds to the casual, slightly self-aware tone.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural flow in Indonesian.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While literally correct (""far from the crowd""), it lacks the nuance of ""off the beaten road."" ""Off the beaten road"" implies a location that is remote and perhaps a little unusual, not just ""far from people."" A better option would be ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a remote location) or ""di tempat yang tidak biasa"" (in an unusual place).

2.  **""kabin kayu yang sebenarnya""**: The phrase ""real log cabin"" is translated as ""kabin kayu yang sebenarnya."" While understandable, it's a bit redundant. ""Sebenarnya"" (actually, truly) isn't necessary. A more natural translation would be ""kabin kayu asli"" (original log cabin) or simply ""kabin kayu.""

3.  **""gambaran sketsanya""**: ""Gambaran sketsanya"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal and clunky. ""Sketsa"" is already a loanword and is commonly used in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""sketsa"" or ""desain sketsa.""

4.  **""mengubahnya sedikit""**: This is a perfectly acceptable translation, but it could be slightly improved for flow. ""Mengubahnya sedikit"" is a bit repetitive. Consider ""memodifikasinya sedikit"" (to modify it a little) or ""memberinya sedikit perubahan"" (to give it a little change).

5.  **""sambil menyesap bir""**: This is a good translation and accurately conveys the action.

The source text is a casual conversation snippet. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses simple language. There are no particularly challenging phrases or cultural references. The sentence structure is relatively simple, with a mix of declarative and exclamatory statements. The key is to maintain this casual, slightly hesitant tone in Indonesian. The phrase ""off the beaten road"" implies a desire for seclusion and a somewhat unconventional location. The repetition of ""of course"" emphasizes the speaker's slightly self-conscious and perhaps slightly whimsical nature.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite match the original.

*   **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian.""** - While accurate, ""jauh dari keramaian"" (far from the crowd) is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a secluded place) or ""di luar jalur utama"" (off the main path). The current phrasing is grammatically correct but lacks the subtle nuance of ""off the beaten road.""
*   **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti kabin kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya.""** - This is a very literal translation and sounds unnatural in Indonesian. It's overly verbose and repetitive. A better translation would be ""Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti kabin kayu, tapi tanpa semua masalah yang ada pada kabin kayu sungguhan."" (I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the problems that come with a real log cabin.) This maintains the meaning while sounding more fluent.
*   **""Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya.""** - This is grammatically correct, but could be smoother. ""Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, lalu membelinya"" (I found the plans on the internet, and then I bought them) flows better.
*   **""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""** - This is fine, but the repetition of ""tentu saja"" (of course) feels a little forced. Consider rephrasing to avoid the repetition, perhaps: ""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin sedikit memodifikasinya."" (But of course, I want to modify it a little.)

The translation correctly implements the analysis by maintaining the core meaning. However, it fails to capture the natural flow and slightly informal tone of the original English. The Indonesian feels a bit stiff and overly literal in places.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---

The source text is a casual conversation snippet. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses simple language. There are no particularly challenging phrases or cultural references. The sentence structure is relatively simple, with a mix of declarative and exclamatory statements. The key is to maintain this casual, slightly hesitant tone in Indonesian. The phrase ""off the beaten road"" implies a desire for seclusion and a somewhat unconventional location. The repetition of ""of course"" emphasizes the speaker's slightly self-conscious and perhaps slightly whimsical nature.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite match the original.

*   **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian.""** - While accurate, ""jauh dari keramaian"" (far from the crowd) is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a secluded place) or ""di luar jalur utama"" (off the main path). The current phrasing is grammatically correct but lacks the subtle nuance of ""off the beaten road.""
*   **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti kabin kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya.""** - This is a very literal translation and sounds unnatural in Indonesian. It's overly verbose and repetitive. A better translation would be ""Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti kabin kayu, tapi tanpa semua masalah yang ada pada kabin kayu sungguhan."" (I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the problems that come with a real log cabin.) This maintains the meaning while sounding more fluent.
*   **""Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya.""** - This is grammatically correct, but could be smoother. ""Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, lalu membelinya"" (I found the plans on the internet, and then I bought them) flows better.
*   **""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""** - This is fine, but the repetition of ""tentu saja"" (of course) feels a little forced. Consider rephrasing to avoid the repetition, perhaps: ""Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin sedikit memodifikasinya."" (But of course, I want to modify it a little.)

The translation correctly implements the analysis by maintaining the core meaning. However, it fails to capture the natural flow and slightly informal tone of the original English. The Indonesian feels a bit stiff and overly literal in places.

The source text is informal and conversational, reflecting a casual discussion about home design. The tone is relaxed and slightly whimsical. The style is simple and direct, using contractions (""There'd be"") and colloquialisms (""right off of it,"" ""see?""). The phrase ""*porte cochere*"" is a specific architectural term, indicating a covered entrance for vehicles. The overall meaning is a description of the layout of a house, focusing on convenience and comfort. The speaker is painting a picture of their vision for the house.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and fail to fully capture the original's tone and style.

1. **""tepat di sampingnya""**: While grammatically correct, ""tepat di sampingnya"" is a bit formal and stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""berdekatan dengan"" (close to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to). The original ""right off of it"" implies immediate adjacency and convenience.
2. **""tahu?""**: The use of ""tahu?"" is overly literal and doesn't quite capture the casual, slightly questioning tone of ""see?"". It feels forced. A better option would be ""kan?"" (right?) or simply omitting it altogether, allowing the sentence to flow naturally.
3. **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Di sanalah"" (that's where) is redundant. A more natural phrasing would be ""Perapian akan ada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there) or ""Perapian akan ditempatkan di sana"" (The fireplace will be placed there).
4. **Repetitive sentence structure**: The translation relies heavily on short, declarative sentences, which makes it sound a bit choppy. Combining some sentences would improve the flow. For example, ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, dan di sana kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar.""
5. **""Untuk steak""**: While understandable, ""Untuk steak"" is a bit abrupt. It lacks the playful tone of the original. A more natural phrasing might be ""Bahkan untuk memanggang steak."" (Even for grilling steaks) or ""Bisa juga untuk memanggang steak."" (Can also be used for grilling steaks).

The translation correctly identifies and translates ""*porte cochere*"", which is good. However, the overall execution lacks the conversational flow and slightly informal tone of the original.

The translation needs improvement in naturalness and stylistic consistency.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is a significant improvement, addressing many of the issues identified in the previous evaluation. The use of ""kan?"" is a good attempt to capture the casual questioning tone of ""see?"". The sentence structure is more natural and less choppy. However, there are still a few minor adjustments that can be made to further enhance the naturalness and flow.

1. **""Di sanalah perapian akan ada""**: While improved, ""Di sanalah"" still feels a little formal. ""Perapian akan ada di sana"" is better, but ""Perapian akan berada di sana"" is even more natural.
2. **""teras itu""**: The addition of ""itu"" (that) is slightly redundant. It's implied that we're referring to the deck mentioned earlier.
3. **""memanggang steak di sana""**: While understandable, ""memanggang steak"" is a bit formal. ""Memanggang steak di sana"" is fine, but ""Bisa juga memanggang steak di sana"" (You could also grill steaks there) might be a more natural way to phrase it, maintaining the suggestion aspect of the original.

Overall, the translation is much closer to the original in terms of tone and style. The changes made are effective in creating a more conversational and natural-sounding Indonesian text.

The source text is a casual, conversational description of a house's layout. The tone is informal and slightly whimsical, reflecting the speaker's imaginative planning. The style is straightforward and uses simple sentence structures. The phrase ""*porte cochere*"" is a specific architectural term, indicating a covered entrance for vehicles. The overall meaning is clear: the speaker is describing the features of a house they are envisioning, focusing on convenience and comfort. The use of phrases like ""see?"" and the informal tone contribute to the conversational feel.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks natural flow and stylistic nuance. Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: While grammatically correct, ""tepat di sampingnya"" is a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""berdekatan dengan"" (close to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to).
2.  **""tanpa basah-basah""**: This is a literal translation of ""without getting wet"" and sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better option would be ""tanpa perlu keluar di bawah hujan"" (without needing to step out in the rain) or ""agar tidak terkena hujan"" (so it doesn't get rained on).
3.  **""lihat?""**: The direct translation of ""see?"" is awkward. It should be replaced with a more natural tag question like ""kan?"" (right?) or simply omitted, as the meaning is implied.
4.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is a bit formal and clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" (There will be a fireplace there) or ""Perapian akan berada di sana.""
5.  **Repetitive use of ""di teras""**: The phrase ""di teras"" is repeated multiple times, making the text sound monotonous. Consider rephrasing some sentences to avoid this repetition. For example, instead of ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras,"" consider ""Kamu juga bisa menggunakan teras untuk memanggang.""

The translation correctly identifies and includes the term ""*porte cochere*"", which is good. However, the overall phrasing needs refinement to achieve a more natural and engaging Indonesian text.

--- VERDICT ---

fail

The translation needs improvement in natural flow and stylistic nuance. Specifically:

*   Replace ""tepat di sampingnya"" with ""berdekatan dengan"" or ""di sebelah.""
*   Replace ""tanpa basah-basah"" with ""tanpa perlu keluar di bawah hujan"" or ""agar tidak terkena hujan.""
*   Replace ""lihat?"" with ""kan?"" or omit it.
*   Rephrase ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" to ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" or ""Perapian akan berada di sana.""
*   Vary the phrasing around the deck to avoid repetition. For example, instead of repeating ""di teras,"" use phrases like ""di area teras"" (in the terrace area) or ""menggunakan teras"" (using the terrace).",Wed Oct 22 17:30:45 2025,"Your primary directive is to provide a fluent, accurate, and contextually appropriate translation from English to Indonesian.
