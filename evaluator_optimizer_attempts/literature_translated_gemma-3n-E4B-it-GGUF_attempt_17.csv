The source text employs a very informal and cynical tone. The phrase ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is highly colloquial and conveys disbelief and contempt. The language is direct and slightly abrasive. The style is straightforward, focusing on conveying information efficiently. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide. The text also establishes a dynamic between the narrator and Deputy Hollis Boxleitner, hinting at a professional relationship with a degree of familiarity.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and informality of the original. While the Indonesian translation conveys the basic meaning, it does so in a more formal and less impactful way.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

*   ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is translated as ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"". While *omong kosong* means ""nonsense,"" it doesn't capture the same level of dismissive, almost vulgar, disbelief as the original. A better option would be something closer to ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!*"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid!) or ""*Bunuh diri? Masa sih?*"" (Suicide? Seriously?). The current translation is too polite and doesn't reflect the narrator's attitude.
*   ""intent face"" is translated as ""wajah serius"". While ""serius"" means serious, it doesn't quite capture the feeling of focused intensity or purpose that ""intent"" implies. A better translation could be ""wajah yang penuh perhatian"" (a face full of attention) or ""wajah yang fokus"" (a focused face).
*   The overall tone is slightly too neutral. The original has a strong sense of the narrator's cynicism, which is not fully conveyed in the Indonesian version.

--- VERDICT ---

The translation needs to be more direct and reflect the informal, cynical tone of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a good start, but the rest of the translation needs adjustments to capture the nuances of the original's language and attitude. Specifically, the translation should aim for more colloquial and impactful phrasing, and avoid overly formal language.

The source text maintains a cynical and informal tone throughout. The phrase ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is a strong expression of disbelief and contempt, setting the narrator's attitude immediately. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms. The style is straightforward, prioritizing conveying information efficiently. The core meaning is that the narrator immediately dismisses the idea of suicide, stating it's not the case. The interaction with Hollis Boxleitner is brief but establishes a familiar, slightly informal dynamic.

--- EVALUATION ---

The provided translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. It successfully captures the informal tone and the dismissive nature of the original. The use of ""*Ampun deh!*"" is a much better equivalent to ""*Suicide, my ass*"" than the previous ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*."" It conveys a similar level of exasperation and disbelief. The phrasing ""nggak mungkin bunuh diri"" effectively translates ""No suicide here."" The description of Hollis Boxleitner's face as ""yang kayak lagi mikir keras"" (looking like he's thinking hard) is a good attempt to capture the ""intent"" aspect, although it's not a perfect match. The overall flow is natural and reads well in Indonesian.

However, there's still room for refinement. While ""ngintip apa yang saya lakuin"" (peeking at what I'm doing) is understandable, it could be slightly more natural. A better option might be ""langsung menoleh untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan"" (immediately turned to see what I was doing) or ""langsung melihat apa yang saya lakukan"" (immediately looked at what I was doing).

The source text employs a very informal and cynical tone. The phrase ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is highly colloquial and conveys disbelief and scorn. The language is direct and somewhat abrasive. The style is straightforward, focusing on conveying information efficiently. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the boy died by suicide. The text also establishes a dynamic between the narrator and Deputy Boxleitner, hinting at a professional relationship with a degree of familiarity.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and informality of the original. While the Indonesian translation conveys the basic meaning, it does so in a more formal and less impactful way.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

*   ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is translated as ""*Bunuh diri, omong kosong*"". While *omong kosong* means ""nonsense,"" it's not a direct equivalent of the dismissive and contemptuous tone of ""*my ass*."" A better option would be something closer to ""Bunuh diri? *Sialan*!"" or ""Bunuh diri? *Jangan bodoh*!"". The original uses a very strong, almost vulgar expression, and the translation softens it considerably.
*   ""intent face"" is translated as ""wajah serius wakil."" While ""serius"" (serious) is accurate, it doesn't capture the intensity of ""intent."" ""Intent"" here implies a focused, perhaps even stern, gaze. A better translation might be ""wajah yang menatap tajam"" (a face that stared sharply) or ""wajah yang serius dan menuntut"" (a serious and demanding face).
*   The overall sentence structure is a bit clunky in places. For example, ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but could be smoother. A more natural phrasing might be ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (using ""dulu"" for ""first"" to sound more natural).

--- VERDICT ---

fail
The translation needs to be more faithful to the original's tone and style. The use of more colloquial and impactful language is crucial. Specifically, the translation should aim for a stronger, more dismissive expression for ""*Suicide, my ass*"", a more vivid description of the deputy's face, and smoother sentence structures that reflect natural Indonesian speech patterns while retaining the original's directness.

The source text maintains a cynical and informal tone. The phrase ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is a strong expression of disbelief and scorn. The language is direct and somewhat abrasive, reflecting the narrator's jaded perspective. The style is straightforward, prioritizing clear communication. The meaning is that the narrator immediately dismisses the idea of suicide, based on their initial assessment of the situation. The interaction with Deputy Boxleitner is brief but establishes a familiar, slightly confrontational dynamic.

--- EVALUATION ---

This translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. It successfully captures the informal tone and the dismissive nature of the original. The use of ""Sialan!"" is a much better equivalent of ""my ass"" in conveying the same level of contempt and disbelief. The sentence structure is more natural and flows better in Indonesian. The description of the deputy's face as having a ""tatapan tajam"" (sharp gaze) is also a strong choice.

However, there's still room for refinement. While ""ngintip"" (peeking) is understandable, it might be slightly too casual. A more nuanced word could be used to describe the deputy's action of checking on the narrator.

The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and informality of the original. While the Indonesian translation conveys the basic meaning, it feels somewhat stiff and lacks the same level of casualness.

Here's a breakdown of specific points:

*   ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is translated as ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"". While ""omong kosong"" means nonsense, it doesn't quite capture the dismissive, almost vulgar, nature of the original. A more suitable translation might be ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh*"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid) or ""*Bunuh diri? Masa sih?*"" (Suicide? Seriously?). The current translation is grammatically correct but lacks the impact.
*   ""reaksi instan, dan terdiam, saya"" - The phrasing is a bit awkward. ""Reaksi instan"" is fine, but ""dan terdiam, saya"" (and silent, I) is not idiomatic. A better phrasing would be ""reaksi langsung, tanpa ragu, saya"" (immediate reaction, without hesitation, I) or ""reaksi instan, tanpa pikir panjang, saya"" (immediate reaction, without thinking, I).
*   ""mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu"" - This is grammatically correct but a bit formal. A more natural phrasing could be ""pergi ke makamnya dulu"" (go to his grave first) or ""menuju makamnya terlebih dahulu"" (head to his grave first).
*   ""wajah serius petugas polisi itu"" - While accurate, ""serius"" (serious) might be too literal. ""Wajah tegas petugas polisi itu"" (the firm/stern face of the police officer) or ""wajah petugas polisi yang serius"" (the serious face of the police officer) could be more natural.

The source text maintains a cynical and informal tone, using strong language (""Suicide, my ass"") to express disbelief. The narrator is clearly skeptical of the initial assumption of suicide and hints at a more sinister explanation. The language is direct and conversational.

This translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. It successfully captures the informal tone and the narrator's cynical attitude. The use of ""Mana mungkin!"" effectively conveys the disbelief of ""my ass."" The phrasing is more natural and idiomatic than before.

Here's a breakdown of specific improvements:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Mana mungkin!*"" - This is a much better translation of ""*Suicide, my ass*."" It retains the dismissive and incredulous tone.
*   ""tanpa basa-basi"" - This is a good addition, conveying the ""silent"" aspect of the original and emphasizing the narrator's lack of politeness or formality.
*   ""nggak mungkin bunuh diri"" - This is a natural and common way to express ""hasn't shot himself"" in Indonesian.
*   ""pacar gandanya yang suka cari masalah itu"" - This is a more descriptive and fitting translation of ""his wild girlfriend,"" implying a troubled relationship.
*   ""muka tegas si polisi itu"" - ""Tegas"" (firm, stern) is a good choice for conveying the intensity of the deputy's expression.

The source text employs informal language (""Suicide, my ass""), contractions (""hadn't""), and a direct, slightly cynical tone. The style is conversational and leans towards a hard-boiled detective narrative. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and explaining their presence at the scene. The tone is one of weary skepticism and a hint of impatience.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original.

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"", itu adalah reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya rasakan. - While ""Omong kosong"" is a valid translation of ""bullshit,"" it feels a bit too strong and less idiomatic than the original ""Suicide, my ass."" The phrase ""itu adalah reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya rasakan"" is grammatically correct but clunky. A more natural phrasing would be something like ""Bunuh diri? *Sialan*."" or ""Bunuh diri? *Nggak mungkin*."" The addition of ""saya rasakan"" is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound overly formal.
*   Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie? - This is a fairly accurate translation, but the phrasing is a bit verbose. ""Alih-alih"" is correct but could be simplified. Consider ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya duluan, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?""
*   Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu. - ""Serius"" is a good translation of ""intent,"" but it doesn't quite capture the nuance of a focused, determined gaze. ""Mendongak pada wajah wakil polisi itu yang tampak serius"" or ""Saya menatap tajam wajah wakil polisi itu"" might be better options.
*   ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku. - This is a direct and accurate translation.

Overall, the translation is understandable, but it lacks the immediacy and informal tone of the original. The phrasing is often too literal and doesn't flow as naturally in Indonesian.

The source text relies heavily on informal language and a cynical tone. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong indicator of the narrator's attitude. The sentences are relatively short and direct, contributing to the overall sense of immediacy. The style is characteristic of hard-boiled detective fiction, prioritizing clarity and impact over elaborate prose.

--- EVALUATION ---

This translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempts. It successfully captures the informal tone and conversational style of the original. The use of ""Jangan bodoh"" is a good equivalent for ""my ass"" in this context, conveying the same level of dismissive disbelief. The phrasing is more natural and flows better in Indonesian.

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh*"", begitu reaksi pertama saya, dalam hati. - Excellent. ""Jangan bodoh"" effectively conveys the dismissive tone.
*   Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh saya lihat makamnya dulu, daripada nyuruh saya nyari Teenie di hutan? - This is a natural and idiomatic translation.
*   Jelas-jelas anak ini nggak mungkin bunuh diri. - Accurate and natural.
*   Dell Teague dibunuh, sama kayak pacarnya yang suka cari masalah itu. - The addition of ""yang suka cari masalah itu"" adds a nice touch, hinting at the girlfriend's personality without being overly verbose.
*   Saya membuka mata. Hollis Boxleitner ngelirik, memastikan saya oke. - ""Ngelirik"" is a perfect choice to convey the quick, assessing glance. ""Memastikan saya oke"" is a natural way to express the deputy checking on the narrator.
*   Saya menatap tajam wajah wakil polisi itu. - Accurate and maintains the intensity of the original.
*   ""Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" jawab saya. - Perfect.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and emotional vulnerability. The tone is somewhat cynical and slightly aggressive, stemming from the feeling of being unfairly judged. The style is straightforward and uses relatively strong vocabulary (""confidence trickster,"" ""impugn""). The meaning revolves around the speaker's discomfort with being perceived as deceptive and their resistance to emotional manipulation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or emotionally wound someone. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a direct attack on their reputation and integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""penipu ulung"" (a master swindler) is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster"" and feels a bit too strong and formal. While accurate, it doesn't quite capture the subtle implication of being *unfairly* accused of trickery. A better option might be something like ""seolah-olah saya sedang ditipu"" (as if I were being tricked) or ""seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" (like someone who is trying to deceive).

""saraf sensitif saya"" (my sensitive nerves) is a literal translation of ""my quick"" and doesn't convey the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to a vulnerable emotional center, a sensitive spot. A more appropriate translation would be ""hati saya"" (my heart) or ""perasaan saya"" (my feelings).

""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (to tarnish our honor) is a correct translation, but it's a bit formal. ""Menghina kehormatan kami"" (to insult our honor) or ""merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (to belittle our honor) might be more natural.

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and uses slightly colorful language (""confidence trickster,"" ""impugn our honor""). The style is direct and personal, reflecting an internal emotional state. The meaning revolves around the speaker's discomfort with being perceived as deceptive and Tolliver's even greater aversion to it. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or cleverness. ""Impugn our honor"" means to attack or discredit someone's reputation or integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. Here's a breakdown:

*   **""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya.""** - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) feels a bit too strong. It might be better to convey the idea of being seen as cunning or sly.
*   **""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akalku.""** - ""Menyentuh akalku"" (touch my wit/mind) is not a natural-sounding Indonesian phrase. While the literal translation is understandable, it doesn't capture the intended meaning of being exploited or having one's cleverness used against them. ""Akal"" can mean wit, intelligence, or cleverness.
*   **""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil.""** - This is a straightforward and acceptable translation.
*   **""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng reputasi kita.""** - ""Mencoreng reputasi kita"" (to stain our reputation) is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal. A more natural alternative might be something like ""merendahkan kehormatan kita"" (to belittle our honor) or ""menjelek-jelekkan kita"" (to slander us).

The overall translation is understandable, but it lacks the subtle emotional impact and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""menyentuh akalku"" is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

--- VERDICT ---

The source text expresses the speaker's annoyance at being perceived as deceptive and Tolliver's even greater dislike of the same. The tone is informal and defensive. The phrase ""touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit someone's cleverness or vulnerabilities. ""Impugn our honor"" means to attack or discredit someone's reputation. The core meaning is about feeling unfairly targeted and having one's intelligence or resourcefulness exploited.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. The choice of ""orang yang suka mengakali"" (someone who likes to trick) is a better fit than ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) as it conveys the intended meaning without being overly strong. ""Memanfaatkan kecerdasanku"" (to exploit my intelligence) is a much more natural and accurate translation of ""touch my quick"" than the previous attempt. ""Merendahkan kehormatan kita"" (to belittle our honor) is a suitable translation of ""impugn our honor.""

The sentence structure and word choices are generally natural and flow well in Indonesian. The translation successfully captures the overall tone and meaning of the original text.

I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and uses slightly colorful language (""confidence trickster,"" ""impugn our honor""). The style is direct and personal, reflecting an internal emotional state. The meaning revolves around the speaker's discomfort with being perceived as deceptive and Tolliver's even greater aversion to it. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or cleverness. ""Impugn our honor"" means to attack or discredit someone's reputation or integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. Here's a breakdown:

*   **""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya.""** - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) feels a bit too strong. It might be better to convey the idea of being seen as cunning or sly.
*   **""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akalku.""** - ""Menyentuh akalku"" (touch my wit/mind) is not a natural-sounding Indonesian phrase. While the literal translation is understandable, it doesn't capture the intended meaning of being exploited or having one's cleverness used against them. ""Akal"" can mean wit, intelligence, or cleverness.
*   **""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil.""** - This is a straightforward and acceptable translation.
*   **""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng reputasi kita.""** - ""Mencoreng reputasi kita"" (to stain our reputation) is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal. A more natural alternative might be something like ""merendahkan kehormatan kita"" (to belittle our honor) or ""menjelek-jelekkan kita"" (to slander us).

The overall translation is understandable, but it lacks the subtle emotional impact and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""menyentuh akalku"" is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and emotional vulnerability. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, reflecting a personal and potentially tense situation. The phrase ""confidence trickster"" implies a feeling of being misunderstood and unfairly accused. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or sensitive points. ""Impugn our honor"" is a formal way of saying to attack someone's reputation or integrity. The overall meaning is that the speaker is uncomfortable with being perceived negatively and is protecting themselves from emotional harm.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally. While understandable, it sounds a bit clunky and less impactful than a more idiomatic expression. ""Penipu ulung"" emphasizes the skill of trickery, which might not be the intended meaning. A better option might be ""orang yang mencoba memanfaatkan saya"" (someone who tries to take advantage of me) or ""dianggap sebagai orang yang licik"" (considered a cunning person), depending on the specific context.

""menyentuh inti saya"" is a literal translation of ""touch my quick."" While understandable, it doesn't capture the figurative meaning. ""Inti saya"" is too literal and doesn't convey the vulnerability implied by the original. A more natural translation would be ""memanipulasi saya"" (manipulate me), ""mengusik saya"" (bother me), or ""mengeksploitasi kelemahan saya"" (exploit my weaknesses).

""mencoreng nama baik kita"" is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and doesn't quite match the tone of the original. A more natural and slightly less formal option would be ""menjelekkan kita"" (to slander us) or ""merusak reputasi kita"" (to damage our reputation).

The source text expresses a feeling of being unfairly labeled and exploited. The speaker feels vulnerable and is actively protecting themselves. The phrase ""confidence trickster"" implies a sense of being misunderstood and accused of dishonesty. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit someone's vulnerabilities or sensitive points. ""Impugn our honor"" means to attack someone's reputation or integrity.

The provided translation is a significant improvement over the initial attempt. It successfully avoids overly literal translations and opts for more natural-sounding Indonesian.

""Saya tidak suka dianggap sebagai orang yang mencoba memanfaatkan saya"" is a good translation of ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster."" It captures the essence of being unfairly labeled as someone who tries to take advantage.

""Saya menarik diri, melindungi diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kelemahan saya"" effectively conveys ""I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick.""

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi kurang berhasil"" accurately translates ""Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful.""

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kita"" is a suitable translation of ""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor."" ""Menyerang reputasi kita"" is a natural way to express the idea of attacking someone's honor.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and emotional vulnerability. The tone is somewhat cynical and slightly aggressive, stemming from the feeling of being unfairly judged. The phrase ""confidence trickster"" implies a perceived accusation of deception or manipulation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to provoke or upset someone deeply, to strike at their core vulnerabilities. The overall meaning is that the speaker is deeply offended by being treated with suspicion and is protecting themselves emotionally. The style is straightforward and direct, typical of narrative prose.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but contains some issues with naturalness and nuance.

1. ""penipu ulung"" - While ""penipu ulung"" translates to ""master swindler"" or ""skilled con artist,"" it's a bit strong and doesn't quite capture the feeling of being unfairly accused. It implies a level of skill and intentionality that might not be present in the original. A better option would be something like ""seolah-olah saya adalah penipu"" (as if I were a trickster) or ""seolah-olah saya mencoba menipu orang"" (as if I were trying to deceive people).

2. ""menyentuh saraf saya"" - This is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't convey the intended meaning. ""Touch my quick"" is an idiom referring to a sensitive spot, a vulnerability. A more appropriate translation would be ""mengusik saya"" (to bother me, to provoke me) or ""menyinggung saya"" (to offend me, to touch upon a sensitive point).

3. ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" - This is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and lacks the punch of the original. ""Mencemarkan nama baik"" is a standard phrase, but consider ""menghina kehormatan kita"" (to insult our honor) or ""merendahkan reputasi kita"" (to belittle our reputation) for a more impactful translation.

The repetition of ""dan"" (and) also makes the sentences feel slightly clunky.

The source text expresses a feeling of being unfairly accused and emotionally wounded. The tone is defensive and slightly indignant. The phrase ""confidence trickster"" implies a perceived accusation of dishonesty or manipulation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression indicating a deeply personal and sensitive point that is being violated. The overall meaning is that the speaker is offended by the accusation and is protecting their emotional vulnerability. The style is direct and conversational.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. It successfully addresses the issues identified in the feedback and conveys the intended meaning more naturally.

1. ""Saya merasa tersinggung diperlakukan seolah-olah saya penipu"" - This is a good translation of ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster."" ""Tersinggung"" accurately captures the feeling of being offended. ""Seolah-olah saya penipu"" is a suitable rendering of ""like a confidence trickster.""

2. ""dan saya yakin Tolliver pasti merasa lebih kesal lagi"" - This is a natural and accurate translation of ""and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less."" ""Pasti merasa lebih kesal lagi"" effectively conveys the increased annoyance Tolliver feels.

3. ""Saya menarik diri, melindungi diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka mengusik saya"" - This is a strong translation of ""I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick."" ""Mengusik saya"" is a good choice for ""touch my quick,"" conveying the idea of provoking or upsetting someone deeply. ""Melindungi diri sendiri"" adds a layer of self-preservation that is appropriate.

4. ""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi kurang berhasil"" - This is a clear and accurate translation of ""Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful.""

5. ""Dia sangat marah ketika orang-orang merendahkan kehormatan kita"" - This is a good translation of ""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor."" ""Merendahkan kehormatan kita"" effectively conveys the meaning of ""impugn our honor.""

The use of ""dan"" is minimal and doesn't create any awkwardness. The overall flow is natural and the translation accurately reflects the tone and meaning of the original.

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and emotional vulnerability. The tone is somewhat cynical and slightly aggressive, stemming from the feeling of being unfairly judged. The phrase ""confidence trickster"" implies a perceived accusation of deception or manipulation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to provoke or upset someone deeply, to strike at their core vulnerabilities. The overall meaning is that the speaker is deeply offended by being treated with suspicion and is protecting themselves emotionally. The style is straightforward and direct, typical of narrative prose.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but contains some issues with naturalness and nuance.

1. ""penipu ulung"" - While ""penipu ulung"" translates to ""master swindler"" or ""skilled con artist,"" it's a bit strong and doesn't quite capture the feeling of being unfairly accused. It implies a level of skill and intentionality that might not be present in the original. A better option would be something like ""seolah-olah saya adalah penipu"" (as if I were a trickster) or ""seolah-olah saya mencoba menipu orang"" (as if I were trying to deceive people).

2. ""menyentuh saraf saya"" - This is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't convey the intended meaning. ""Touch my quick"" is an idiom referring to a sensitive spot, a vulnerability. A more appropriate translation would be ""mengusik saya"" (to bother me, to provoke me) or ""menyinggung saya"" (to offend me, to touch upon a sensitive point).

3. ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" - This is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and lacks the punch of the original. ""Mencemarkan nama baik"" is a standard phrase, but consider ""menghina kehormatan kita"" (to insult our honor) or ""merendahkan reputasi kita"" (to belittle our reputation) for a more impactful translation.

The repetition of ""dan"" (and) also makes the sentences feel slightly clunky.

--- VERDICT ---

fail
The translation needs improvement in naturalness and conveying the intended emotional impact. Specifically, the phrases ""penipu ulung,"" ""menyentuh saraf saya,"" and ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" should be reconsidered for more nuanced and impactful alternatives that better reflect the original's tone and meaning. The use of conjunctions could also be refined for smoother reading.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal, yet the language is direct and emotionally charged. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, and the phrase ""touch my quick"" is a figurative expression for being vulnerable or exploited. ""Impugn our honor"" is a formal way of saying to attack someone's reputation or integrity. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to undermine them.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""penipu ulung"" - While ""penipu ulung"" translates to ""master swindler,"" it's a bit too strong and lacks the subtle implication of being unfairly accused. ""Penipu"" (a swindler) is too direct and doesn't capture the feeling of being wrongly labeled. A better option would be ""orang yang dituduh sebagai penipu"" (a person accused of being a swindler) or ""seolah-olah aku adalah penipu"" (as if I were a swindler).

2. ""menyentuh keunggulanku"" - ""Keunggulan"" translates to ""excellence"" or ""superiority."" This doesn't accurately capture the meaning of ""touch my quick,"" which refers to a vulnerable spot or emotional core. A more appropriate translation would be ""menyentuh kelemahanku"" (touching my weakness) or ""membuatku rentan"" (making me vulnerable).

3. ""kurang berhasil"" - This is a very literal translation of ""less successful"" and sounds clunky in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""tidak berhasil seperti dia"" (not as successful as he is) or ""tidak seefektif dia"" (not as effective as he is).

4. ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" - ""Mencoreng"" means ""to stain"" or ""to tarnish."" While accurate, it's a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the intensity of ""impugn."" A better option could be ""menyerang reputasi kami"" (attacking our reputation) or ""merusak nama baik kami"" (damaging our good name).

The source text is a casual conversation snippet from a novel. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses simple language. The meaning is clear and conveys a sense of intimacy and personal revelation. The speaker is hesitant to share their dream, highlighting its somewhat unusual nature. The use of ""of course"" indicates a slightly self-aware and perhaps slightly defensive tone, as if anticipating a potential critique.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from slightly unnatural phrasing in a few places.

*   **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While literally correct (""far from the crowd""), it lacks the nuance of ""off the beaten road."" ""Off the beaten road"" implies a sense of seclusion and remoteness, not just distance from people. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tersembunyi"" (in a hidden place).
*   **""kabin kayu yang sebenarnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit clunky. ""Kabin kayu yang sebenarnya"" translates to ""the actual log cabin."" A more natural phrasing would be ""kabin kayu sungguhan"" (real log cabin) or ""kabin kayu asli"" (original log cabin).
*   **""gambaran sketsanya""**: While understandable, ""gambaran sketsanya"" is a bit formal and less common than a simpler phrasing. ""Sketsa rumah"" (house sketch) or ""desain sketsa"" (sketch design) would sound more natural.
*   **""menyesap bir""**: This is a perfectly acceptable translation of ""taking a sip of beer,"" but it's a bit formal. ""Minum bir"" (drink beer) is more common in casual conversation.

--- VERDICT ---

The source text remains a casual, conversational snippet. The tone is relaxed and slightly hesitant, as the speaker reveals a personal dream. The style is simple and direct. The core meaning is clear: the speaker is describing their dream house, emphasizing its remote location and the desire for a log cabin aesthetic without the associated practical difficulties. The repetition of ""of course"" suggests a slight self-awareness or defensiveness regarding the dream's unconventional nature.

--- EVALUATION ---

The previous attempt is a significant improvement, addressing many of the issues identified in the earlier evaluation. The phrasing is more natural and idiomatic than the initial translation. However, there's still room for refinement.

*   **""jauh dari hiruk pikuk kota""**: While better than ""jauh dari keramaian,"" it's still a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""di tempat yang sepi"" (in a quiet place) or ""di daerah yang tenang"" (in a peaceful area).
*   **""kesulitan yang ada di kabin kayu sungguhan""**: This is grammatically correct but a bit verbose. ""Kesulitan di kabin kayu"" (difficulties in a log cabin) would be more concise and natural.
*   **""sketsa desainnya""**: While acceptable, ""sketsa rumah"" (house sketch) is slightly more common and flows better.
*   **""meneguk bir""**: This is a good choice, but ""minum bir"" (drink beer) is still a perfectly acceptable and slightly more casual alternative.

Overall, the translation is quite good and effectively conveys the meaning and tone of the original. The remaining issues are minor and don't significantly detract from the overall quality.

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---

The source text is a casual conversation snippet from a novel. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses simple language. The meaning is clear and conveys a sense of intimacy and personal revelation. The speaker is hesitant to share their dream, highlighting its somewhat unusual nature. The use of ""of course"" indicates a slightly self-aware and perhaps slightly defensive tone, as if anticipating a potential critique.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from slightly unnatural phrasing in a few places.

*   **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While literally correct (""far from the crowd""), it lacks the nuance of ""off the beaten road."" ""Off the beaten road"" implies a sense of seclusion and remoteness, not just distance from people. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tersembunyi"" (in a hidden place).
*   **""kabin kayu yang sebenarnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit clunky. ""Kabin kayu yang sebenarnya"" translates to ""the actual log cabin."" A more natural phrasing would be ""kabin kayu sungguhan"" (real log cabin) or ""kabin kayu asli"" (original log cabin).
*   **""gambaran sketsanya""**: While understandable, ""gambaran sketsanya"" is a bit formal and less common than a simpler phrasing. ""Sketsa rumah"" (house sketch) or ""desain sketsa"" (sketch design) would sound more natural.
*   **""menyesap bir""**: This is a perfectly acceptable translation of ""taking a sip of beer,"" but it's a bit formal. ""Minum bir"" (drink beer) is more common in casual conversation.

--- VERDICT ---

fail

The translation is understandable, but it lacks the natural flow and subtle nuances of the original English. The phrasing in several places is too literal and doesn't fully capture the conversational tone. The suggested improvements aim to make the Indonesian sound more idiomatic and less like a direct translation. Specifically, the phrases ""jauh dari keramaian,"" ""kabin kayu yang sebenarnya,"" and ""gambaran sketsanya"" need refinement to better reflect the original's meaning and tone.

The source text is a casual conversation snippet from a novel. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses simple language.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate and conveys the core meaning of the source text. However, there are a few areas where the Indonesian translation could be improved to better match the natural flow and nuance of the original.

1. ""off the beaten road"" is translated as ""di tempat yang terpencil."" While accurate, it's a bit literal. A more idiomatic translation would be better. Consider ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" or ""di pinggiran kota/desa."" The current translation is grammatically correct but lacks a certain stylistic flair.

2. ""inconveniences of a real log cabin"" is translated as ""kerumitan sebuah kabin kayu yang sebenarnya."" This is also a bit literal and clunky. ""Kerumitan"" is a good translation of ""inconveniences,"" but the phrasing could be smoother. Consider ""kekurangan sebuah kabin kayu yang asli"" or ""masalah yang biasanya dihadapi dengan kabin kayu.""

3. The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" (""Of course"") is translated directly as ""Tentu saja."" While not incorrect, it can sound a little repetitive in Indonesian. Consider using a different phrase to convey the same meaning, such as ""Tentu saja, tapi..."" or simply omitting it in some instances if the context is clear.

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---

The source text remains consistent with the previous analysis. It's a casual, conversational snippet where the speaker is describing their dream house to Hollis. The tone is relaxed and the style is straightforward. The core meaning revolves around a desire for a secluded, log-cabin-esque house, but one that avoids the practical difficulties associated with a real log cabin. The repetition of ""of course"" highlights the speaker's assumptions and desires.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is a significant improvement over previous attempts. The use of ""agak ragu"" (a bit hesitant) after ""Baiklah"" adds a touch of realism and reflects the speaker's reluctance to discuss this topic. The phrase ""di tempat yang terpencil"" is a good choice for ""off the beaten road."" Replacing ""semua masalah yang biasanya ada di kabin kayu asli"" with ""semua kesulitan yang biasanya menyertai kabin kayu asli"" is more natural and idiomatic. The use of ""mengubahnya"" (to change it) is a good fit for ""alter it.""

The source text is a casual conversation snippet from a novel. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses simple language. The meaning is clear and conveys a sense of intimacy and a slightly quirky personality in the speaker. The speaker is describing a dream house with specific, somewhat unusual requirements. The use of ""of course"" indicates a self-aware and slightly humorous tone.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from slightly unnatural phrasing in a few places.

*   **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While literally correct, ""jauh dari keramaian"" (far from the crowd) sounds a bit formal and less natural than other options. A better choice might be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di luar jalur utama"" (off the main path). This is a subtle point, but it affects the overall flow.
*   **""ketidaknyamanan sebuah kabin kayu yang sebenarnya""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan sebuah kabin kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the inconveniences of a real log cabin) is grammatically correct but doesn't flow well. A more natural phrasing would be ""kekurangan sebuah kabin kayu asli"" (the drawbacks of a real log cabin) or ""masalah yang biasanya ada pada kabin kayu asli"" (the problems usually found in a real log cabin).
*   **""rancangannya di Internet""**: This is acceptable, but ""desainnya di Internet"" (the design on the Internet) might be slightly more common and natural.
*   **""menyesap bir""**: This is a good translation and works well.

The source text remains a casual, conversational snippet. The tone is relaxed and slightly quirky, reflecting the speaker's unusual dream house. The style is straightforward and accessible. The core meaning is clear: the speaker is describing a dream house that combines a desired aesthetic (log cabin) with practical considerations (avoiding the downsides of a real log cabin). The repetition of ""of course"" adds a touch of self-awareness and lightheartedness.

--- EVALUATION ---

The previous translation is a significant improvement over the initial attempt. The changes made address the clunkiness of the earlier version and create a more natural flow in Indonesian.

*   **""terpencil""**: The choice of ""terpencil"" (remote) is a good improvement over ""jauh dari keramaian"" (far from the crowd) as it better captures the feeling of being off the beaten path.
*   **""kerumitan yang biasanya ada pada kabin kayu asli""**: This is a much better way of expressing ""inconveniences of a real log cabin"" than the previous, more literal translation. It conveys the idea of practical drawbacks more effectively.
*   **""gambarnya di internet""**: Using ""gambar"" (picture/image) is more natural than ""rancangan"" (design) in this context, as the speaker likely found a visual plan rather than detailed architectural blueprints.
*   **""menghirup birnya""**: This is a good, natural way to say ""taking a sip of beer.""

However, there's still room for refinement. The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" feels a little forced. While accurate, it could be made more subtle.

While understandable, it doesn't capture the idiomatic meaning of ""off the beaten road,"" which implies remoteness and a sense of adventure or seclusion. A better translation would be something like ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tidak biasa"" (in an unusual place).
*   **""without the inconveniences of a real log cabin""**: Translated as ""tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (without the actual inconveniences of a log cabin). This is overly literal and clunky. It could be rephrased to something like ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya dihadapi di pondok kayu"" (but without the usual problems encountered in a log cabin) or ""tetapi dengan kenyamanan yang lebih baik daripada pondok kayu biasa"" (but with more comfort than a typical log cabin).
*   **""alter it a little""**: Translated as ""mengubahnya sedikit"" (change it a little). This is fine, but could be more evocative. Consider ""memodifikasinya sedikit"" (modify it a little) or ""memberinya sentuhan pribadi"" (give it a personal touch), depending on the intended nuance.
*   **Repetition of ""Tentu""**: While ""Tentu"" is a perfectly acceptable translation of ""Of course,"" its repetition feels a bit unnatural. Consider using a different phrase like ""Tentu saja,"" ""Ya,"" or simply omitting it in the second instance.

The source text is a casual conversation snippet from a novel. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and uses simple language. The meaning is clear and conveys a sense of intimacy and personal revelation. The speaker is hesitant to share their dream, indicating it's a somewhat private thought. The use of ""of course"" suggests a slightly self-aware and perhaps slightly whimsical tone.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. It successfully captures the nuances of the original English and reads more naturally in Indonesian. The changes made address the issues identified in the previous evaluation.

*   **""off the beaten road""**: Translated as ""terletak di tempat yang terpencil"" (located in a remote place). This is a more idiomatic and natural translation than ""di tempat yang jauh dari keramaian.""
*   **""without the inconveniences of a real log cabin""**: Rephrased to ""dengan kenyamanan yang lebih baik, tanpa semua kesulitan yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu biasa"" (with better comfort, without all the usual difficulties found in a typical log cabin). This is a more elegant and natural way of expressing the idea.
*   **""alter it a little""**: Translated as ""memodifikasinya sedikit"" (modify it a little). This is a good choice, conveying the idea of making changes without drastically altering the original design.
*   **Repetition of ""Tentu""**: The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is handled well, with the second instance being replaced with ""Tentu saja,"" which is more natural.

The overall flow and phrasing are much smoother and more idiomatic than the previous version. The translation effectively conveys the speaker's hesitant and slightly whimsical tone.

The source text is informal and conversational, reflecting a casual tone. The speaker is describing the layout of a house in a relaxed manner, using contractions (""There'd be"") and colloquialisms (""right off of it,"" ""see?""). The style is descriptive and aims to paint a picture for the listener. The meaning is straightforward: the speaker is detailing the features of a house, focusing on convenience and comfort. The use of the term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of affluence and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and natural flow in certain areas. While the literal meaning is conveyed, the Indonesian translation feels somewhat stiff and doesn't fully capture the conversational tone of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""with the washroom right off of it"" translated as ""dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya."" While accurate, ""tepat di sampingnya"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan."" (with the bathroom that is adjacent).

2. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars..."" translated as ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil..."" The use of the loanword ""*porte cochere*"" is acceptable, but it might benefit from a brief explanation or a more descriptive phrase if the target audience isn't familiar with the term. Consider: ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada area *porte cochere* untuk mobil..."" or ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada tempat berteduh untuk mobil, sebuah *porte cochere*...""

3. ""so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet"" translated as ""jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" This is grammatically correct but lacks the casual feel of the original. A better option would be ""jadi kamu bisa langsung bawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa kena hujan."" (so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet from the rain).

4. ""There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see?"" translated as ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?"" The addition of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is a direct translation of the tag question and is appropriate, but it can feel a bit forced. It might be better to rephrase the sentence slightly to incorporate the sense of confirmation. For example: ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, *kamu tahu*?"" (There's a deck on the right side of the kitchen, you know?) or ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, *bisa lihat*?"" (There's a deck on the right side of the kitchen, can you see?).

5. ""Or maybe I'd put it off the family room."" translated as ""Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" ""Di samping"" is accurate but a bit formal. ""Di dekat"" (near) or ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) might sound more natural.

6. ""And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks."" translated as ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras itu. Untuk steak."" This is fine, but could be slightly more idiomatic. ""Dan kamu bisa memasang pemanggang gas di teras itu. Untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can install a gas grill on the deck. To grill steaks.)

The source text remains informal and conversational. The speaker is casually describing the layout of a house, using contractions and colloquialisms. The tone is relaxed and friendly, aiming to paint a picture for the listener. The inclusion of ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of comfort and attention to detail. The overall meaning is straightforward: the speaker is detailing the features of the house, emphasizing convenience and comfort.

--- EVALUATION ---

This translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. It successfully captures the conversational tone of the original text, using more natural and idiomatic Indonesian expressions. The use of ""plus"" instead of a more formal phrase is a good choice. The inclusion of ""*kamu lihat?*"" is appropriate for conveying the casual, questioning tone. The phrasing regarding the *porte cochere* and the placement of the deck is more natural and less clunky. The use of ""buat bakar steak"" is a very natural and colloquial way to express ""for steaks.""

However, there's still room for minor refinement. While the translation is generally good, some phrases could be slightly smoother.

1. ""Aku lagi lihat ke bawah sambil gambar di meja dengan jari."" While understandable, ""Aku lagi lihat ke bawah sambil menggambar di meja dengan jari"" is slightly more formal and perhaps more natural.

2. ""Di situ nanti ada perapian..."" could be slightly improved to ""Di sana nanti akan ada perapian..."" or ""Di situ nanti akan ada perapian."" The addition of ""akan"" (will be) adds a touch of formality, but it's a subtle point.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---

The source text is informal and conversational, reflecting a casual tone. The speaker is describing the layout of a house in a relaxed manner, using contractions (""There'd be"") and colloquialisms (""right off of it,"" ""see?""). The style is descriptive and aims to paint a picture for the listener. The meaning is straightforward: the speaker is detailing the features of a house, focusing on convenience and comfort. The use of the term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of affluence and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and natural flow in certain areas. While the literal meaning is conveyed, the Indonesian translation feels somewhat stiff and doesn't fully capture the conversational tone of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""with the washroom right off of it"" translated as ""dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya."" While accurate, ""tepat di sampingnya"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan."" (with the bathroom that is adjacent).

2. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars..."" translated as ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil..."" The use of the loanword ""*porte cochere*"" is acceptable, but it might benefit from a brief explanation or a more descriptive phrase if the target audience isn't familiar with the term. Consider: ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada area *porte cochere* untuk mobil..."" or ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada tempat berteduh untuk mobil, sebuah *porte cochere*...""

3. ""so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet"" translated as ""jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" This is grammatically correct but lacks the casual feel of the original. A better option would be ""jadi kamu bisa langsung bawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa kena hujan.""

5. ""Or maybe I'd put it off the family room."" translated as ""Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" ""Di samping"" is accurate but a bit formal. ""Di dekat"" (near) or ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) might sound more natural.

6. ""And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks."" translated as ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras itu. Untuk steak.""

The translation is generally accurate but lacks natural flow and some nuances of the original. Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga."" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""Ruang kerja"" is a literal translation of ""study"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Kantor"" or ""ruang belajar"" might be more natural depending on the context.
2. ""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya."" - This is also grammatically correct but a bit redundant. ""Tepat di sampingnya"" is unnecessary. A simpler phrasing like ""dengan kamar mandi di dekatnya"" would be more natural.
3. ""Di belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah."" - The use of ""*porte cochere*"" is good, but the sentence is a bit long and convoluted. Consider breaking it into two sentences for clarity. ""Jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena air hujan"" is a more natural way to phrase this.
4. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat?"" - This is a bit abrupt. Adding a softening phrase like ""Lihat, ada teras di sisi kanan dapur"" would improve the flow.
5. ""Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" - ""Menempatkannya"" is a bit vague. It's unclear what ""it"" refers to. Clarifying the pronoun would improve clarity.
6. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras."" - This is grammatically correct but could be smoother. ""Di sanalah perapian akan ditempatkan, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras"" is slightly more elegant.

The source text is a casual, conversational description of a house's layout. The tone is informal and slightly whimsical, reflecting the speaker's imaginative planning. The style is simple and direct, using contractions (""There'd be"") and colloquialisms (""right off of it""). The meaning is straightforward: the speaker is describing the features of a house they are envisioning, focusing on convenience and comfort. The use of the term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of affluence and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and natural flow in certain areas. While the literal meaning is conveyed, the Indonesian translation feels somewhat stiff and doesn't fully capture the conversational tone of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1.  ""*plus ruang keluarga*"" - While grammatically correct, ""plus"" feels a bit formal in this context. A more natural phrasing would be ""dan ruang keluarga"" (and a family room) or even just ""ruang keluarga"" if the ""plus"" isn't strictly necessary.
2.  ""*tepat di sampingnya*"" - This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it."" While understandable, it's not the most idiomatic way to express proximity. Consider ""berdekatan dengan"" (close to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to) depending on the desired emphasis.
3.  ""*tanpa basah-basah*"" - This is a literal translation of ""without getting wet."" It's a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""agar tidak terkena air"" (so it doesn't get wet) or ""tanpa perlu keluar di bawah hujan"" (without needing to step out in the rain).
4.  ""*lihat?*"" - While acceptable, this feels a little abrupt. A softer alternative could be ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply omitting it altogether, as the question implies a suggestion.
5.  ""*Di sanalah perapian akan berada*"" - This is grammatically correct but a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" (There will be a fireplace there) or ""Perapian akan berada di sana.""
6.  ""*Untuk steak.*"" - This is a very literal translation. It's grammatically correct, but it feels a bit tacked on and doesn't quite fit the flow of the sentence. It could be rephrased to something like ""Bahkan untuk memanggang steak."" (Even for grilling steaks) or ""Bisa juga untuk memanggang steak."" (It could also be for grilling steaks).

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""with the washroom right off of it"" translated as ""dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya."" While accurate, ""tepat di sampingnya"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan."" (with the bathroom adjacent to it).

2. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars..."" translated as ""Di belakang rumah, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil..."" The word ""*porte cochere*"" is retained, which is appropriate, but the sentence could be smoother. Consider: ""Di bagian belakang rumah, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (At the back of the house, there will be a *porte cochere* for cars, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.) This improves the flow and clarifies the purpose.

3. ""see?"" translated as ""lihat?"". While ""lihat"" is a direct translation of ""see?"", it feels a bit abrupt and doesn't quite capture the informal, questioning tone. A better option would be ""kan?"" or ""bukan?"". These are more common in informal Indonesian conversation and convey the same sense of seeking confirmation or agreement. For example: ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, kan?"" (There's a deck on the right side of the kitchen, right?).

4. ""Or maybe I'd put it off the family room."" translated as ""Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" ""Di samping"" is accurate, but less idiomatic than other options. ""Di dekat"" (near) or ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) might be more natural.

5. ""For steaks."" translated as ""Untuk steak."" This is fine, but could be slightly more descriptive to match the casual tone. ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (for grilling steaks) or ""Untuk steak panggang"" (for grilled steaks) would be more fitting.

--- EVALUATION ---

This translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. It successfully captures the informal tone and conversational style of the original English. The use of more natural Indonesian phrasing, such as ""plus ruang keluarga"" instead of a more formal construction, and the inclusion of ""kan?"" to seek confirmation, enhances the natural flow and reflects the speaker's casual manner. The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without sounding overly literal. The use of ""buat"" is appropriate for informal speech. The overall impression is that the translation reads smoothly and naturally in Indonesian, effectively conveying the speaker's vision.

The source text is informal and conversational, reflecting a casual discussion about house plans. The tone is relaxed and descriptive, using colloquialisms like ""There'd be..."" and phrases like ""right off of it."" The style is straightforward and aims to paint a picture for the listener. The meaning is clear: the speaker is describing the layout of a house, focusing on convenience and comfort. The use of the term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of affluence and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and natural flow in certain areas. While the literal meaning is conveyed, the Indonesian translation feels somewhat stiff and doesn't fully capture the conversational tone of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""There'd be..."" is translated as ""Akan ada..."". While grammatically correct, it lacks the casual feel of the original. Consider using a more colloquial phrasing like ""Bakalan ada..."" or ""Nanti akan ada..."" to better reflect the informal tone.
2. ""right off of it"" is translated as ""tepat di sampingnya"". This is accurate but a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""benar-benar bersebelahan"" or ""langsung di sampingnya"".
3. ""Around back"" is translated as ""Di belakang"". This is fine, but could be improved with a more descriptive phrase like ""Di bagian belakang rumah"" to provide more context.
4. ""*Porte cochere*"" is retained as ""*porte cochere*"". While this is acceptable, it might be beneficial to include a brief explanation or synonym in parentheses the first time it's used, especially if the target audience isn't familiar with the term. For example, ""*porte cochere* (tempat mobil berteduh di depan pintu).""
5. ""see?"" is translated as ""lihat?"". This is a direct translation and works, but it could be replaced with a more natural tag question like ""kan?"" or ""bukan?"".
6. ""For steaks"" is translated as ""Untuk steak"". This is correct, but it feels a little abrupt. A more natural phrasing might be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" or ""Supaya bisa memanggang steak"".

--- VERDICT ---

fail

The translation conveys the core meaning but lacks the natural flow and conversational tone of the original. The phrasing is often too literal and lacks the subtle nuances of informal Indonesian. The use of ""lihat?"" feels a bit clunky.

The source text remains informal and conversational. The speaker is casually outlining house plans, using contractions and colloquialisms. The tone is relaxed and friendly, aiming to convey a sense of ease and practicality. The inclusion of ""*porte cochere*"" indicates a certain level of sophistication and attention to detail. The overall impression is of a comfortable and well-designed home.

--- EVALUATION ---

The provided translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempts. It successfully captures the informal tone and conversational style of the original. The use of words like ""bakal"" (will), ""plus,"" and ""lagi"" (am/is) contributes to a more natural and relaxed feel. The inclusion of ""kan?"" is a good way to replicate the tag question ""see?"". The translation is generally accurate and avoids overly formal language.

However, there are still a few minor areas for refinement:

1. ""plus ruang keluarga"" - While understandable, ""dan ruang keluarga"" is slightly more natural.
2. ""bawain belanjaan"" - While correct, ""membawa belanjaan"" is a bit more formal but still appropriate.
3. ""di teras itu"" - This is a little redundant. ""di teras"" is sufficient.
4. ""Biar bisa memanggang steak"" - While understandable, ""Supaya bisa memanggang steak"" is slightly more formal and perhaps more appropriate given the overall tone.
