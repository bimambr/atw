the translation is generally accurate, but the phrase ""kekasihnya yang riang"" (his lively girlfriend) is a significant flaw. while it conveys the idea of a ""wild girlfriend,"" it lacks the nuance and slightly cynical tone of the original ""wild girlfriend."" the original implies a certain recklessness or unconventionality that ""riang"" doesn't fully capture. this isn't a simple word choice issue; it alters the characterization of the girlfriend and, by extension, the overall tone of the passage. the rest of the translation is relatively faithful and understandable.

**2. suggest improvements:**

replace ""kekasihnya yang riang"" with a phrase that better reflects the original's tone and implication of recklessness. options include:

*   ""kekasihnya yang liar"" (his wild girlfriend - a more direct translation)
*   ""pacar gilanya"" (his crazy girlfriend)
*   ""kekasihnya yang eksentrik"" (his eccentric girlfriend)

the translation is largely accurate, but the phrase ""omong kosong"" for ""my ass"" is too informal and lacks the impactful, slightly vulgar tone of the original. while ""omong kosong"" means ""nonsense,"" it doesn't carry the same dismissive, sarcastic weight as the english idiom. the use of ""wakil"" for ""deputy"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less natural in this context. the sentence structure is generally sound, but the overall impact is lessened by the less-than-ideal word choices.

the translation is generally accurate, but the phrase ""memanfaatkan kebaikan saya"" (exploit my kindness) is a significant flaw. while not a direct mistranslation, it shifts the meaning from ""touch my quick"" (which implies exploiting someone's vulnerabilities or weaknesses, often in a manipulative way) to a more general sense of being taken advantage of. this alters the nuance of the original text, which carries a stronger implication of being targeted and exploited due to a perceived weakness. the phrase ""meragukan reputasi kami"" (doubt our reputation) is also slightly weaker than ""impugn our honor."" ""impugn"" carries a stronger sense of directly attacking someone's integrity and character.

The translation is generally accurate, but the phrase ""kelemahan saya"" (my weakness) is a significant flaw. While it conveys a similar idea to ""quick"" in the original, it lacks the nuance of vulnerability and defensiveness implied by ""quick"" in this context. ""Quick"" here refers to a person's sensitive spots, vulnerabilities that, when touched, provoke a strong reaction. ""Kelemahan saya"" is too broad and doesn't capture this specific meaning. The phrase ""mencemarkan nama baik kami"" (defame our honor) is also a bit formal and doesn't quite match the tone of the original, which uses ""impugn our honor.""

the translation is generally accurate, but there are a few areas that could be improved. the phrase ""tepat di sampingnya"" (right next to it) is a bit clunky and less natural than a more idiomatic indonesian expression. while understandable, it lacks fluency. also, the repetition of ""akan ada"" (there will be) is somewhat monotonous and could be varied. the use of ""anda"" (you - formal) is consistent, but in this context, it feels slightly overly formal and less natural than a more casual pronoun. the use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is also a bit awkward and doesn't quite capture the conversational tone of the original.

**2. suggest improvements:**

*   replace ""tepat di sampingnya"" with a more natural phrase like ""berdekatan dengan"" (close to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to).
*   vary the phrasing of the descriptions of the rooms. for example, instead of repeating ""akan ada,"" use phrases like ""ada juga..."" (there is also...) or ""ruang..."" (a room...).
*   consider using a less formal pronoun than ""anda"" in certain instances, perhaps ""kamu"" (you - informal) if the context allows for it.
*   replace ""lihat?"" with a more natural way to indicate a suggestion or observation, such as ""atau"" (or) or simply omitting it.

“Tentu,” katanya sambil menghela napas.

Rumahnya akan memiliki dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga. Ada dapur di sana, berdekatan dengan kamar mandi.

the translation is generally accurate, but there are a few areas that could be improved. the phrase ""taking a sip of beer"" is translated as ""menghela napas"" which means ""sigh"". while a sigh *could* accompany taking a sip of beer, it doesn't accurately convey the intended meaning. the original implies a casual, relaxed action. the translation introduces a slightly negative connotation. also, the repetition of ""tentu saja"" (of course) feels a bit unnatural and clunky in indonesian. while grammatically correct, it lacks the flow of the original.

**2. suggest improvements:**

*   replace ""menghela napas"" with a more appropriate phrase like ""sambil menyesap bir"" (while sipping beer) or ""sambil minum bir"" (while drinking beer).
*   rephrase the repeated ""tentu saja"" to something more natural, such as ""tentu,"" or omit it entirely if the context makes it redundant.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""","“Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,” kata Hollis, sambil tersenyum.

the translation is generally accurate, but there are a few areas that could be improved. the phrase ""jauh dari keramaian"" (far from the crowds) is a bit too literal and doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""off the beaten road."" it implies remoteness rather than seclusion. also, the repetition of ""tentu saja"" (of course) feels slightly unnatural and clunky. while accurate, it lacks stylistic flow. the use of ""berdekatan dengan kamar mandi"" (adjacent to the bathroom) is grammatically correct but less elegant than a more natural phrasing. finally, the sentence structure in the last paragraph is a bit long and could be broken down for better readability.

**2. suggest improvements:**

*   replace ""jauh dari keramaian"" with a more idiomatic expression conveying seclusion, such as ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang sepi"" (in a quiet place).
*   reduce the repetition of ""tentu saja."" consider rephrasing to avoid the direct translation. for example, ""tentu saja,..."" could be replaced with ""tentu saja, tetapi..."" or simply omitted in some instances.
*   rephrase ""berdekatan dengan kamar mandi"" to something like ""dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan"" (with an adjacent bathroom) or ""dengan kamar mandi yang berada tepat di sampingnya"" (with a bathroom right next to it).
*   break down the long sentence in the last paragraph into two or three shorter, more digestible sentences.
