The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong, dismissive expression. The style is direct and conversational, using contractions (""hadn't"") and a relatively simple sentence structure. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide. The text also establishes a sense of mystery and a slightly detached, observant narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and informality of the original. The phrase ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" is a literal translation and feels somewhat stiff and less impactful than ""Suicide, my ass."" While ""omong kosong"" means nonsense, it doesn't quite capture the dismissive, almost vulgar tone of the original. The sentence structure is also a bit clunky in places. ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but lacks the natural flow of the English. The use of ""mengunjungi makamnya"" (visit his grave) is a bit formal; a more natural phrasing might be ""pergi ke makamnya"" (go to his grave). ""Wajah serius seorang wakil"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy"" and doesn't convey the same sense of focused observation. ""Intant"" is not the right word to describe the face of a deputy.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" - Needs a more impactful and informal equivalent. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid!) or ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin!"" (Suicide? Impossible!).
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me..."" -> ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya..."" - While grammatically correct, it's a bit formal. Consider ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya..."" (Why didn't Sybil employ me...).
*   ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""wajah serius seorang wakil"" - This is a literal translation and doesn't capture the nuance. Consider ""wajah yang fokus dari seorang wakil"" (the focused face of a deputy) or ""wajah seorang wakil yang memperhatikan"" (the face of a deputy who is observing).

The source text employs a cynical, slightly sarcastic, and informal tone. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""playboy""). The style is narrative, presenting the narrator's internal thoughts and observations. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is investigating a death that is not a suicide, and expresses frustration with the circumstances of the investigation. The use of ""my ass"" is an emphatic denial, and the overall tone suggests a seasoned detective who is unimpressed with the situation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone, but some phrases feel unnatural or overly literal. ""Bunuh diri? Masa sih?"" is a common Indonesian expression for disbelief, but it lacks the punch and cynicism of ""Suicide, my ass."" ""Reaksi instan, dan sunyi"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat stiff. ""Sunyi"" (silent) is a bit redundant given the context. ""Anak ini"" (this boy) is a bit too casual and lacks the detective's detached observation. ""Wajah serius wakil itu"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy"" and doesn't quite convey the intended meaning. ""Wakil"" is a formal term for deputy, which feels out of place in the informal context. The phrase ""Nggak mungkin bunuh diri di sini"" is a direct translation of ""No suicide here"" and is acceptable, but lacks the impact of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Masa sih?"" - While understandable, it lacks the sarcastic bite. Consider ""Sok bunuh diri?"" (Pretend to commit suicide?) or ""Bisa-bisa bunuh diri?"" (Could he possibly have committed suicide?) to convey the cynicism.
* ""Of course this boy hadn't shot himself."" -> ""Jelas-jelas anak ini nggak bunuh diri."" - ""Jelas-jelas"" is a bit too emphatic and sounds unnatural. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja dia tidak bunuh diri."" (Of course, he didn't commit suicide.) or ""Dia jelas tidak bunuh diri."" (He clearly didn't commit suicide.)
* ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""Wajah serius wakil itu"" - ""Serius"" (serious) is too bland. Consider ""Ekspresi wajah wakil itu menunjukkan..."" (The deputy's facial expression showed...) or ""Wajah wakil itu menunjukkan..."" (The deputy's face showed...).
* ""No suicide here"" -> ""Nggak mungkin bunuh diri di sini"" - This is grammatically correct but lacks the original's directness. ""Tidak mungkin bunuh diri di sini"" is better, but still lacks impact.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective narrating a crime scene. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""playboy""). The style is straightforward, focusing on conveying information and the narrator's internal thoughts. The meaning is clear: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and stating that a murder has occurred. The text relies on a somewhat gritty and realistic portrayal of a crime scene.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the nuance and impact of the original. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is translated as ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh,"" which is a literal translation and doesn't capture the dismissive, sarcastic tone of the original. ""My ass"" is a very strong idiom and ""Jangan bodoh"" is too mild. The translation of ""wild girlfriend"" as ""pacar playboy-nya"" is a bit awkward. While ""playboy"" conveys a sense of a carefree, possibly irresponsible partner, it doesn't fully capture the original's implication of a more untamed, perhaps even dangerous, relationship. The phrase ""intent face"" is translated as ""wajah serius,"" which is accurate but lacks the subtle implication of purpose or focus that ""intent"" conveys. The overall flow is acceptable, but the phrasing feels somewhat stiff and lacks the naturalness of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh"" - Needs a more impactful and sarcastic translation. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira!"" (Don't think it!), or even a more colloquial and slightly vulgar option if the target audience is receptive to it, but it must maintain the dismissive tone.
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa mayat di sana dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" - The translation changes the action from reading the grave to examining the body. While the meaning is similar, it alters the original's implication that Sybil was looking for clues at the grave site. The phrasing is also a bit clunky.
3. ""Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend."" -> ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar playboy-nya."" - ""Playboy"" is a weak translation. Consider ""pacar yang agak liar"" (a somewhat wild girlfriend) or ""pacar yang bermasalah"" (a problematic girlfriend) to better capture the original's implication of a troubled relationship.
4. ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil itu."" - ""Intent"" implies a focused, purposeful gaze. ""Serius"" is accurate but doesn't convey the same sense of intensity. Consider ""Saya menatap wajah wakil itu dengan tatapan tajam"" (I stared at the deputy's face with a sharp gaze) or ""Saya menatap wajah wakil itu dengan penuh perhatian"" (I stared at the deputy's face with attention).

The source text employs a casual, cynical, and slightly aggressive tone. The language is informal, using slang (""my ass,"" ""gue""). The style is direct and conversational, reflecting the narrator's impatience and frustration. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and is revealing that a murder has occurred. The use of colloquialisms and contractions contributes to the overall tone and characterization.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone but misses several nuances. ""Suicide, my ass"" is translated as ""Bunuh diri? Dasar bodoh!"" which is a bit too harsh and loses the sarcastic, dismissive quality of the original. ""Dasar bodoh!"" translates to ""you idiot"" and doesn't quite convey the narrator's disbelief and disdain. The use of ""gue"" is appropriate for the informal tone, but the overall phrasing feels somewhat clunky and less natural than the original.

""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" is translated as ""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh gue lihat makamnya dulu, daripada nyuruh ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" This is a fairly accurate translation, but the sentence structure is a bit awkward in Indonesian. The flow is not as smooth as the original.

""I looked into the intent face of the deputy"" is translated as ""Gue tatap muka wakil itu dengan tatapan tajam."" While ""tatap muka"" means ""face to face,"" ""dengan tatapan tajam"" (with a sharp gaze) is redundant and less elegant than the original. The original implies a focused, intense look, which is better conveyed with a single word or phrase.

""No suicide here,"" I said. is translated as ""Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku."" This is a direct and accurate translation.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases and potential alternatives:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Sialan, bunuh diri? / Percuma saja mencoba bunuh diri."" (The first option is more direct and retains the cynicism. The second option is slightly more formal but still conveys disbelief.)
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil nggak minta gue datang ke sini untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim gue ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (More natural flow and slightly more formal.)
3. ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Aku menatap tajam wajah wakil itu."" (More concise and impactful.)

--- CONTEXT ---
Text type: fictional text, novel excerpt
Source Language: English
Target Language: Indonesian

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
*Suicide, my ass*, was my instant, and silent, reaction. Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie? Of course this boy hadn't shot himself. Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend. I opened my eyes. Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing. I looked into the intent face of the deputy. ""No suicide here,"" I said.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective narrating a crime scene. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""playboy""). The style is straightforward, focusing on conveying information and the narrator's internal thoughts. The meaning is clear: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and stating that a murder has occurred. The text relies on a somewhat gritty and realistic portrayal of a crime scene.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the nuance and impact of the original. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is translated as ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh,"" which is a literal translation and doesn't capture the dismissive, sarcastic tone of the original. ""My ass"" is a very strong idiom and ""Jangan bodoh"" is too mild. The translation of ""wild girlfriend"" as ""pacar playboy-nya"" is a bit awkward. While ""playboy"" conveys a sense of a carefree, possibly irresponsible partner, it doesn't fully capture the original's implication of a more untamed, perhaps even dangerous, relationship. The phrase ""intent face"" is translated as ""wajah serius,"" which is accurate but lacks the subtle implication of purpose or focus that ""intent"" conveys. The overall flow is acceptable, but the phrasing feels somewhat stiff and lacks the naturalness of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh"" - Needs a more impactful and sarcastic translation. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira!"" (Don't think it!), or even a more colloquial and slightly vulgar option if the target audience is receptive to it, but it must maintain the dismissive tone.
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa mayat di sana dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" - The translation changes the action from reading the grave to examining the body. While the meaning is similar, it alters the original's implication that Sybil was looking for clues at the grave site. The phrasing is also a bit clunky.
3. ""Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend."" -> ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar playboy-nya."" - ""Playboy"" is a weak translation. Consider ""pacar yang agak liar"" (a somewhat wild girlfriend) or ""pacar yang bermasalah"" (a problematic girlfriend) to better capture the original's implication of a troubled relationship.
4. ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil itu."" - ""Intent"" implies a focused, purposeful gaze. ""Serius"" is accurate but doesn't convey the same sense of intensity. Consider ""Saya menatap wajah wakil itu dengan tatapan tajam"" (I stared at the deputy's face with a sharp gaze) or ""Saya menatap wajah wakil itu dengan penuh perhatian"" (I stared at the deputy's face with attention).

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, using a strong, colloquial phrase (""Suicide, my ass""). The style is direct and conversational, reflecting the narrator's immediate, somewhat dismissive reaction. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide and believes foul play was involved. The language is relatively simple and straightforward.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the tone and meaning reasonably well, but there are several areas for improvement.

1. ""Sialan, bunuh diri? Aku tak percaya."" - While ""Sialan"" is a suitable equivalent for ""my ass"" in terms of expressing frustration, ""Aku tak percaya"" is a bit too literal and lacks the punch of the original. A more natural and impactful translation would be ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!"" or ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin!"". The current phrasing feels slightly awkward.

2. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak memintaku memeriksa makamnya dulu, alih-alih mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" - This is grammatically correct but a bit clunky. ""Alih-alih"" is a formal word and doesn't quite fit the conversational tone. A better option would be ""Kenapa Sybil tidak memintaku memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?"". This is more natural and maintains the intended meaning.

3. ""Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri."" - This is a direct and accurate translation, but it could be strengthened. ""Anak ini"" (this boy) is a bit vague. Consider ""Tentu saja dia tidak bunuh diri"" (Of course, he didn't commit suicide) for a more natural flow.

4. ""Aku menatap tajam wajah wakil itu."" - ""Menatap tajam"" is a bit redundant. ""Aku menatap tajam wajah wakil itu"" is acceptable, but ""Aku menatap tajam wajah wakil itu"" is more concise and impactful.

Overall, the translation is understandable, but it lacks the immediacy and slightly abrasive tone of the original. The language is a bit too formal in places.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text employs a casual, cynical, and slightly aggressive tone. The language is informal, using slang (""my ass,"" ""gue""). The style is direct and conversational, reflecting the narrator's impatience and frustration. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and is revealing that a murder has occurred. The use of colloquialisms and contractions contributes to the overall tone and characterization.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone but misses several nuances. ""Suicide, my ass"" is translated as ""Bunuh diri? Dasar bodoh!"" which is a bit too harsh and loses the sarcastic, dismissive quality of the original. ""Dasar bodoh!"" translates to ""you idiot"" and doesn't quite convey the narrator's disbelief and disdain. The use of ""gue"" is appropriate for the informal tone, but the overall phrasing feels somewhat clunky and less natural than the original.

""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" is translated as ""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh gue lihat makamnya dulu, daripada nyuruh ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" This is a fairly accurate translation, but the sentence structure is a bit awkward in Indonesian. The flow is not as smooth as the original.

""I looked into the intent face of the deputy"" is translated as ""Gue tatap muka wakil itu dengan tatapan tajam."" While ""tatap muka"" means ""face to face,"" ""dengan tatapan tajam"" (with a sharp gaze) is redundant and less elegant than the original. The original implies a focused, intense look, which is better conveyed with a single word or phrase.

""No suicide here,"" I said. is translated as ""Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku."" This is a direct and accurate translation.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases and potential alternatives:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Sialan, bunuh diri? / Percuma saja mencoba bunuh diri."" (The first option is more direct and retains the cynicism. The second option is slightly more formal but still conveys disbelief.)
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil nggak minta gue datang ke sini untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim gue ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (More natural flow and slightly more formal.)
3. ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Aku menatap tajam wajah wakil itu."" (More concise and impactful.)

The source text employs a cynical, slightly sarcastic tone. The language is informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""my ass"" (though softened to ""Suicide, my ass""). The style is straightforward and focuses on conveying information efficiently. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that Dell Teague committed suicide and believes he was murdered. The text also establishes the narrator's relationship with Sybil and Hollis Boxleitner, and hints at a dangerous situation involving Dell Teague and his girlfriend.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and nuance of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri?* Reaksi instan saya, dan sunyi."" is a literal translation and doesn't quite capture the dismissive, almost aggressive tone of ""Suicide, my ass."" While ""sunyi"" (silent) is accurate, it doesn't convey the underlying contempt.

The sentence ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit clunky. The phrasing is a bit too formal for the narrator's voice. A more natural translation would be needed to reflect the narrator's frustration and sarcasm.

""Pacar pemberani miliknya"" is a literal translation of ""wild girlfriend"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Wild"" in this context implies a rebellious, perhaps dangerous, personality. ""Pemberani"" (brave) doesn't convey this.

""Wajah serius wakil"" is a correct translation of ""intent face of the deputy,"" but ""serius"" is a bit bland. A more evocative word would be better.

The final sentence, ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" is a direct and accurate translation.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""*Bunuh diri?* Reaksi instan saya, dan sunyi.""  Needs a more impactful and sarcastic translation. Consider something like ""*Bunuh diri?* Jangan bodoh."" or ""*Bunuh diri?* Omong kosong!"" to capture the dismissive tone.

2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?""  Needs to be rephrased for a more natural and sarcastic tone.  Consider: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak langsung memintaku memeriksa makamnya, daripada memaksaku mencari Teenie di hutan?"" (Why didn't Sybil just ask me to check the grave directly, instead of forcing me to search for Teenie in the woods?)

3. ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar pemberani miliknya"" Needs a more accurate translation that conveys the rebellious nature. Consider: ""pacar yang sulit ditangani"" (difficult girlfriend) or ""pacar yang pemberontak"" (rebellious girlfriend).

4. ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""wajah serius wakil"" Needs a more descriptive word. Consider: ""wajah tegas wakil"" (firm face of the deputy) or ""wajah mengawasi wakil"" (watching face of the deputy).

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" could be improved to something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid.) or ""*Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.*"" (Suicide? Impossible.) These options better convey the narrator's disbelief and sarcasm.
*   ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk datang ke sini untuk melihat makamnya dulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is a bit wordy. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya mencari Teenie ke hutan?"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to see the grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?)
*   ""Pacar sosialnya yang pemberani"" is not idiomatic. Consider ""*pacar yang keras kepala*"" (stubborn girlfriend), ""*pacar yang bebas*"" (free-spirited girlfriend), or ""*pacar yang eksentrik*"" (eccentric girlfriend), depending on the nuance desired. ""Wild"" implies a certain untamed quality.
*   ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil"" is a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Saya melihat wajah serius wakil."" (I saw the serious face of the deputy.) or ""Saya menatap wajah wakil yang serius."" (I stared at the serious face of the deputy.)

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective narrating a crime scene. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""Omong kosong""). The style is straightforward, focusing on conveying information and the narrator's internal thoughts. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide and believes a murder has occurred. The text relies on a somewhat gritty and realistic portrayal of a crime scene.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri?* Omong kosong!"" is a direct translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" but it feels a bit too literal and lacks the same level of dismissive sarcasm. ""Omong kosong"" is a common Indonesian phrase for nonsense, but it doesn't quite capture the visceral rejection of the idea present in the original.

The sentence ""Kenapa Sybil tidak langsung memintaku memeriksa makamnya, daripada memaksaku mencari Teenie di hutan?"" is grammatically correct but sounds slightly clunky. ""Memaksaku"" (forcing me) is a bit strong; ""minta"" (asking) would be more natural in this context. The structure could be improved for better flow.

""Saya menatap wajah tegas wakil itu"" is a perfectly acceptable translation of ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy,"" but ""tegas"" (firm, resolute) doesn't fully capture the nuance of ""intent,"" which implies a focused and perhaps even menacing look.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""*Bunuh diri?* Omong kosong!"" - Needs a more impactful and sarcastic equivalent. Consider something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!*"" (Suicide? Don't be foolish!) or ""*Bunuh diri? Mimpi saja!*"" (Suicide? Dream on!).
*   ""Kenapa Sybil tidak langsung memintaku memeriksa makamnya, daripada memaksaku mencari Teenie di hutan?"" - Rephrase to something like ""*Mengapa Sybil tidak langsung meminta saya memeriksa makamnya, alih-alih mengirim saya mencari Teenie di hutan?*"" (Why didn't Sybil directly ask me to check the grave, instead of sending me to find Teenie in the woods?).
*   ""Saya menatap wajah tegas wakil itu"" - Consider ""*Saya menatap wajah wakil itu yang tampak serius*"" (I stared at the deputy's serious face) or ""*Saya menatap wajah wakil itu yang penuh perhatian*"" (I stared at the deputy's attentive face).

I looked into the intent face of the deputy. ""No suicide here,"" I said.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text employs a cynical, slightly sarcastic tone. The language is informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""my ass"" (though softened to ""Suicide, my ass""). The style is straightforward and focuses on conveying information efficiently. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that Dell Teague committed suicide and believes he was murdered. The text also establishes the narrator's relationship with Sybil and Hollis Boxleitner, and hints at a dangerous situation involving Dell Teague and his girlfriend.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and nuance of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri?* Reaksi instan saya, dan sunyi."" is a literal translation and doesn't quite capture the dismissive, almost aggressive tone of ""Suicide, my ass."" While ""sunyi"" (silent) is accurate, it doesn't convey the underlying contempt.

The sentence ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit clunky. The phrasing is a bit too formal for the narrator's voice. A more natural translation would be needed to reflect the narrator's frustration and sarcasm.

""Pacar pemberani miliknya"" is a literal translation of ""wild girlfriend"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Wild"" in this context implies a rebellious, perhaps dangerous, personality. ""Pemberani"" (brave) doesn't convey this.

""Wajah serius wakil"" is a correct translation of ""intent face of the deputy,"" but ""serius"" is a bit bland. A more evocative word would be better.

The final sentence, ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" is a direct and accurate translation.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""*Bunuh diri?* Reaksi instan saya, dan sunyi.""  Needs a more impactful and sarcastic translation. Consider something like ""*Bunuh diri?* Jangan bodoh."" or ""*Bunuh diri?* Omong kosong!"" to capture the dismissive tone.

2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?""  Needs to be rephrased for a more natural and sarcastic tone.  Consider: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak langsung memintaku memeriksa makamnya, daripada memaksaku mencari Teenie di hutan?"" (Why didn't Sybil just ask me to check the grave directly, instead of forcing me to search for Teenie in the woods?)

3. ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar pemberani miliknya"" Needs a more accurate translation that conveys the rebellious nature. Consider: ""pacar yang sulit ditangani"" (difficult girlfriend) or ""pacar yang pemberontak"" (rebellious girlfriend).

4. ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""wajah serius wakil"" Needs a more descriptive word. Consider: ""wajah tegas wakil"" (firm face of the deputy) or ""wajah mengawasi wakil"" (watching face of the deputy).

The translation attempts to capture the meaning of the source text but falls short in replicating its tone and style. The phrase ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is translated as ""*Bunuh diri? Sialan*.""

A more natural phrasing would be ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, melainkan mengirim saya mencari Teenie di hutan?"".

The phrase ""intent face of the deputy"" is translated as ""wajah serius wakil itu."" While ""serius"" is a valid translation for ""intent,"" it lacks the nuance of the original. ""Intent"" implies a focused, determined, and perhaps even judgmental look. ""Serius"" simply means serious. A better translation would be ""wajah yang menunjukkan ketegasan wakil itu"" or ""wajah wakil yang tampak tegas.""

The source text employs a cynical and informal tone, characterized by colloquialisms (""my ass""), rhetorical questions, and a direct, almost brusque style. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical of the initial assumption that Dell Teague committed suicide, and is frustrated by the circumstances of being sent to investigate. The style is conversational and uses contractions (""hadn't""). The text also hints at a darker, more complex narrative with the mention of a murder alongside the suicide investigation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone, but misses some nuances. ""Pintar-pintar saja"" translates to ""You're so clever"" or ""Smart aleck,"" which doesn't quite convey the sarcastic and dismissive feeling of ""Suicide, my ass."" The phrase ""dalam hati"" (in my heart) is unnecessary and adds a layer of formality that isn't present in the original. ""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu"" is a literal translation of ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first,"" but it sounds a bit clunky and less natural than the original. ""Nggak ada bunuh diri"" is a correct translation of ""No suicide here,"" but lacks the same punch and conviction. ""Wacil itu"" is a very literal translation of ""wakil itu"" (that deputy) and is not as natural sounding.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""Suicide, my ass"": ""Pintar-pintar saja"" - This is a significant misinterpretation. The Indonesian translation lacks the sarcastic and dismissive tone. Consider alternatives like ""Bisa-bisanya,"" which conveys a similar sense of disbelief and scorn.
* ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first"": ""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu"" - This is grammatically correct but lacks the natural flow of the original. A better option would be ""Kenapa Sybil nggak minta aku mulai dengan memeriksa makamnya dulu?"" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to start by checking his grave first?)
* ""intent face"": ""wajah tegas"" - While ""tegas"" means firm or resolute, it doesn't fully capture the ""intent"" feeling. Consider ""wajah serius"" (serious face) or ""wajah yang menunjukkan tekad"" (a face showing determination).
* ""No suicide here"": ""Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini"" - While grammatically correct, it lacks the emphatic tone of the original. Consider ""Bukan bunuh diri!"" (Not a suicide!) or ""Tidak mungkin bunuh diri!"" (Impossible that it's a suicide!).

1.  ""*Suicide, my ass*"" should be translated to something closer to ""Bisa suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, daripada nyuruh cari Teenie di hutan? *Palsu!*"" or ""*Bisa suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, daripada nyuruh cari Teenie di hutan? Dasar bodoh!*"" to convey the dismissive and sarcastic tone.
2.  ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, melainkan mengirim saya mencari Teenie di hutan?"" is a better phrasing than the current translation.
3.  ""wajah yang menunjukkan ketegasan wakil itu"" or ""wajah wakil yang tampak tegas"" would be more appropriate than ""wajah serius wakil itu"" to capture the intended meaning of ""intent.""

*Suicide, my ass*, was my instant, and silent, reaction. Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie? Of course this boy hadn't shot himself. Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend. I opened my eyes. Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong, dismissive expression. The style is direct and conversational, using contractions (""hadn't"") and a relatively simple sentence structure. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide. The text establishes a mystery and hints at foul play.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and naturalness of the original. The phrase ""Bunuh diri, omong kosong"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. ""Omong kosong"" is a valid Indonesian word for nonsense, but it doesn't carry the same level of contempt as the English idiom.

The sentence ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat stiff. The phrasing is a bit too formal for the narrator's voice. A more natural phrasing would be needed to reflect the informal tone.

""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil"" is a literal translation of ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" While understandable, ""serius"" (serious) doesn't quite convey the nuance of ""intent,"" which implies a focused and perhaps even stern expression.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases and potential improvements:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri, omong kosong"" could be improved to something like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh."" (Suicide? Don't be foolish.) or ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin."" (Suicide? Impossible.) These options retain the dismissive tone while sounding more natural. Another option could be ""Bunuh diri? Masa sih?"" (Suicide? Really?)

2. ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak memintaku memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to look for Teenie?) This is a more natural and conversational phrasing.

3. ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil"" -> ""Saya menatap wajah wakil yang serius."" (I stared at the serious face of the deputy.) or ""Saya menatap wajah wakil yang tegas."" (I stared at the firm/resolute face of the deputy.) ""Tegas"" might better capture the intended meaning of ""intent"" in this context.

The source text employs a cynical, informal, and slightly sarcastic tone. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" "" nggak mungkin""). The style is conversational, reflecting the narrator's internal monologue and immediate reactions. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that someone died by suicide and is setting up a scenario of foul play. The use of ""wild girlfriend"" suggests a character with unconventional or eccentric behavior.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone using Indonesian slang (""Jangan kira begitu,"" ""nggak mungkin""). However, the translation is overly literal and lacks nuance. The phrase ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira begitu"" is a direct translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" but it doesn't quite convey the same level of dismissive sarcasm. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak suruh aku lihat makamnya duluan, malah nyuruh aku ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat awkward and less natural than the original. The use of ""nyentrik"" to translate ""wild"" is a possible option, but it might not fully capture the intended meaning of eccentric or unconventional. ""Wajah wakil yang tegas"" is a decent translation of ""intent face of the deputy,"" but it lacks the subtle implication of authority and seriousness. The overall translation is understandable but lacks the punch and immediacy of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira begitu."" While understandable, it lacks the visceral impact of the original. Consider: ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh."" (Don't be stupid) or ""Bunuh diri? Mimpi saja."" (Just dreaming).
* ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak suruh aku lihat makamnya duluan, malah nyuruh aku ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" This is grammatically correct but sounds clunky. A more natural phrasing could be: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak memintaku untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, malah mengirimku ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to check the grave first, instead sending me to the forest to look for Teenie?)
* ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""wajah wakil yang tegas."" ""Tegas"" (firm, resolute) is accurate but doesn't fully capture the sense of purpose and scrutiny implied by ""intent."" Consider: ""wajah wakil yang serius"" (serious face of the deputy) or ""wajah wakil yang menuntut"" (demanding face of the deputy).

The source text employs a cynical, informal, and slightly sarcastic tone. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" "" nggak mungkin""). The style is conversational and leans towards a hard-boiled detective narrative. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and stating that a murder has occurred. The use of ""wild girlfriend"" suggests a somewhat unconventional or troubled relationship.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone, but it falls short in several areas. The use of ""Jangan kira begitu"" is a decent attempt at ""my ass,"" but it lacks the punch and dismissive attitude of the original. ""Nggak mungkin bunuh diri"" is a direct translation of ""hadn't shot himself"" but feels a bit clunky. The translation of ""pacar-pacarnya yang agak… unik"" is problematic. While ""unik"" translates to ""unique,"" it doesn't fully capture the implication of ""wild."" It could be interpreted as simply ""unique"" or even ""strange"" rather than hinting at a chaotic or unconventional personality. The word ""serius"" for ""intent"" is accurate but doesn't quite convey the same feeling of focused observation. The overall flow is acceptable, but the phrasing in several places feels unnatural and lacks the immediacy of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

* ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira begitu."" - While understandable, it lacks the impact of ""Suicide, my ass."" Consider something more forceful, like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh."" (Suicide? Don't be stupid.) or ""Bunuh diri? Mimpi saja."" (Suicide? Dream on.)
* ""Kenapa Sybil tidak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, malah nyuruh aku ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" - This is grammatically correct but feels a bit too literal. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruhku melihat makamnya dulu, malah mengirimku ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil tell me to see his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?)
* ""Dell Teague ini dibunuh, sama seperti pacar-pacarnya yang agak… unik."" - ""Agak unik"" is weak. Consider ""pacar-pacarnya yang agak gila"" (his somewhat crazy girlfriends) or ""pacar-pacarnya yang agak aneh"" (his somewhat strange girlfriends), depending on the intended nuance. If ""wild"" implies a chaotic lifestyle, ""agak gila"" might be more appropriate.
* ""Aku menatap wajah serius wakil itu."" - ""Serius"" is accurate, but consider ""Aku mengamati wajah wakil itu dengan seksama"" (I observed the deputy's face carefully) to better convey the narrator's focused attention.

The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass"") to convey disbelief and frustration. The style is straightforward, focusing on conveying information and the narrator's internal thoughts. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide and believes a murder has occurred. The text also establishes a relationship between the narrator and Hollis Boxleitner, a deputy.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is translated as ""Bunuh diri? Mimpi saja."" While understandable, ""mimpi saja"" (just a dream) doesn't quite capture the dismissive, sarcastic tone of ""my ass."" It's a bit too literal and lacks the idiomatic impact.

The sentence ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" is translated as ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruhku melihat makamnya dulu, malah mengirimku ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" This is grammatically correct, but the phrasing feels a little stiff. A more natural Indonesian phrasing might be ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" The use of ""memeriksa"" (to examine) instead of ""melihat"" (to see) adds a touch of formality that better reflects the detective's professional demeanor.

The phrase ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy"" is translated as ""Aku menatap wajah wakil itu dengan seksama."" While ""dengan seksama"" (carefully) is accurate, it's a bit redundant. ""Menatap"" (to stare) already implies a focused gaze. A more concise and natural translation would be ""Aku menatap wajah wakil itu.""

The overall translation is understandable, but it lacks the subtle nuances of the original. The tone is slightly less cynical and the style is a bit more formal than the source text.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to better capture the original's tone and style. Specifically:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" should be translated with a more idiomatic and sarcastic phrase. Consider options like ""Sialan, bunuh diri?"" or ""Jangan bodoh, bunuh diri?"" depending on the desired level of informality.
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" could be improved with a more natural phrasing like ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?""

Text type: fictional text, novel excerpt
Source Language: English
Target Language: Indonesian

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
*Suicide, my ass*, was my instant, and silent, reaction. Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie? Of course this boy hadn't shot himself. Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend. I opened my eyes. Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing. I looked into the intent face of the deputy. ""No suicide here,"" I said.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text employs a cynical, informal, and slightly sarcastic tone. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" "" nggak mungkin""). The style is conversational and leans towards a hard-boiled detective narrative. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and stating that a murder has occurred. The use of ""wild girlfriend"" suggests a somewhat unconventional or troubled relationship.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone, but it falls short in several areas. The use of ""Jangan kira begitu"" is a decent attempt at ""my ass,"" but it lacks the punch and dismissive attitude of the original. ""Nggak mungkin bunuh diri"" is a direct translation of ""hadn't shot himself"" but feels a bit clunky. The translation of ""pacar-pacarnya yang agak… unik"" is problematic. While ""unik"" translates to ""unique,"" it doesn't fully capture the implication of ""wild."" It could be interpreted as simply ""unique"" or even ""strange"" rather than hinting at a chaotic or unconventional personality. The word ""serius"" for ""intent"" is accurate but doesn't quite convey the same feeling of focused observation. The overall flow is acceptable, but the phrasing in several places feels unnatural and lacks the immediacy of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

* ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira begitu."" - While understandable, it lacks the impact of ""Suicide, my ass."" Consider something more forceful, like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh."" (Suicide? Don't be stupid.) or ""Bunuh diri? Mimpi saja."" (Suicide? Dream on.)
* ""Kenapa Sybil tidak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, malah nyuruh aku ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" - This is grammatically correct but feels a bit too literal. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruhku melihat makamnya dulu, malah mengirimku ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil tell me to see his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?)
* ""Dell Teague ini dibunuh, sama seperti pacar-pacarnya yang agak… unik."" - ""Agak unik"" is weak. Consider ""pacar-pacarnya yang agak gila"" (his somewhat crazy girlfriends) or ""pacar-pacarnya yang agak aneh"" (his somewhat strange girlfriends), depending on the intended nuance. If ""wild"" implies a chaotic lifestyle, ""agak gila"" might be more appropriate.
* ""Aku menatap wajah serius wakil itu."" - ""Serius"" is accurate, but consider ""Aku mengamati wajah wakil itu dengan seksama"" (I observed the deputy's face carefully) to better convey the narrator's focused attention.

The source text employs a casual, cynical, and slightly sarcastic tone. The language is informal, using slang (""my ass"") and contractions. The style is direct and conversational, reflecting the narrator's internal monologue and immediate reactions. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and reveals that the death is actually a murder. The text relies on a certain level of familiarity with the situation and the characters.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and nuance of the original. The use of ""Sialan, bunuh diri?"" is a reasonable attempt to capture the disbelief, but it's a bit too blunt and lacks the subtle sarcasm of ""Suicide, my ass."" The phrase ""Reaksi instan dan terdiam saya"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat stiff and unnatural in Indonesian. ""Terdiam"" implies silence in a more passive way than the original implies. ""Anak ini"" is a bit informal and could be improved. ""Wali"" is a more appropriate translation for ""girlfriend"" in this context, conveying the wildness of the relationship. ""Wakil"" is a standard translation for ""deputy"" but lacks the slightly more formal feel of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases and suggestions:

* ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Sialan, bunuh diri?"" could be improved to ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh."" (Suicide? Don't be foolish.) or ""Bunuh diri? Masa sih?"" (Suicide? Seriously?) to better capture the sarcastic tone.
* ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa makamnya dulu, malah mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but clunky. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, padahal malah mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil tell me to check his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?)
* ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah wakil itu."" is accurate but lacks the descriptive quality of ""intent."" Consider ""Saya menatap wajah wakil itu dengan tatapan menyelidik."" (I stared at the deputy's face with a probing gaze.)
* ""No suicide here,"" I said. -> ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku. is fine, but could be slightly more emphatic: ""Bukan bunuh diri!"" kataku. (Not a suicide!)

The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. ""Omong kosong"" means ""nonsense,"" which is not quite the same as the original's contemptuous rejection. The sentence structure is also a bit clunky in places. For example, ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less impactful than the original. The phrase ""wajah serius petugas polisi itu"" is also a bit stiff; ""intent face"" implies a focused, perhaps even stern, expression, which isn't fully conveyed.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases and potential improvements:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" could be improved to something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*"" or ""*Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.*"" These options retain the dismissive tone while sounding more natural in Indonesian.
*   ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" could be rephrased to ""*Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?*"" This makes the sentence flow more naturally and uses more common phrasing.

The source text employs a cynical and informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass""), contractions (""hadn't""), and a direct, conversational style. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and is investigating a murder. The style is active and uses short sentences for impact. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong expression of disbelief and sarcasm.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone but falls short in several areas. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Ampun deh,* reaksi instan dan terdiam saya"" is a bit awkward. ""Ampun deh"" is a common Indonesian expression, but it doesn't quite convey the same level of dismissive sarcasm as ""my ass."" ""Reaksi instan dan terdiam saya"" is grammatically correct but lacks the punch of the original. ""Terdiam"" implies silence, which isn't the primary point; the reaction is more about disbelief.

The translation of ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" is also somewhat clunky. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" is understandable but lacks the natural flow of the original. The phrasing is too literal.

""Intent face"" is translated as ""wajah tegang petugas polisi itu."" While ""tegang"" (tense) is accurate, it doesn't capture the nuance of ""intent,"" which implies a focused, perhaps even intimidating, expression.

The translation of ""No suicide here"" as ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" is accurate but lacks the directness of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""Suicide, my ass"": Needs a more impactful and sarcastic equivalent. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid!) or ""Bunuh diri? Masa sih!"" (Suicide? Seriously!).
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me..."":  A more natural phrasing would be ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to check his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?).
*   ""Intent face"": Consider ""wajah yang serius"" (serious face) or ""wajah yang menatap tajam"" (a face that stares sharply) to better convey the feeling of the original.
*   ""No suicide here"": ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini"" is correct, but ""Bukan bunuh diri!"" (It's not suicide!) would be more direct and impactful.

The style is concise and uses short sentences to convey a sense of immediacy and thought process.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. ""Omong kosong"" means ""nonsense,"" which is not quite the same as the original's contemptuous rejection. The sentence structure is also a bit clunky in places. For example, ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less impactful than the original. The phrase ""wajah serius petugas polisi itu"" is also a bit stiff; ""intent face"" implies a focused, perhaps even stern, expression, which isn't fully conveyed.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases and potential improvements:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" could be improved to something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*"" or ""*Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.*"" These options retain the dismissive tone while sounding more natural in Indonesian.
*   ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" could be rephrased to ""*Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?*"" This makes the sentence flow more naturally and uses more common phrasing.
*   ""Saya menatap wajah serius petugas polisi itu"" could be improved to ""*Saya menatap wajah petugas polisi yang serius.*"" or ""*Saya menatap wajah tegang petugas polisi itu.*"" ""Tegang"" (tense) might better capture the feeling of the deputy's expression.

The source text employs a cynical and informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass""), contractions (""hadn't""), and a direct, conversational style. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and reveals that the death is actually a murder. The style is active and uses short sentences for impact. The use of italics emphasizes the narrator's disbelief.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone with ""Sialan,"" which is a reasonable attempt to convey the disbelief. However, the translation suffers from several issues. Firstly, the phrase ""Bunuh diri? *Sialan*"" feels a bit abrupt and lacks the punch of the original. The italics are missing, which diminishes the impact of the narrator's disbelief. Secondly, ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat clunky and overly formal. The phrasing is too literal and doesn't flow naturally in Indonesian. ""Memeriksa makamnya dulu"" is a bit verbose. ""Alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" is also a bit stiff. The sentence could be restructured for better flow. Thirdly, ""pacar playboynya"" is a literal translation of ""wild girlfriend"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Wild"" in this context implies a rebellious or unconventional personality, not necessarily a playboy lifestyle. The translation should convey the girlfriend's unconventional nature. Finally, ""petugas polisi itu"" is a bit redundant. ""Petugas"" already implies a police officer.

Here are specific examples for improvement:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? *Sialan!*"" (Adding the exclamation mark and italics is crucial.) or ""Bunuh diri? *Jangan bodoh!*"" (Don't be foolish!) or ""Bunuh diri? *Tidak mungkin!*"" (Impossible!)
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak memintaku untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" or ""Mengapa Sybil tidak memintaku untuk memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirimku ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (The second option is slightly more natural.)
3. ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar yang agak nakal"" (a somewhat naughty girlfriend) or ""pacar yang eksentrik"" (an eccentric girlfriend) or ""pacar yang bebas"" (a free girlfriend). The best choice depends on the specific nuance intended.

--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text employs a cynical and informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass""), contractions (""hadn't""), and a direct, conversational style. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and is investigating a murder. The style is active and uses short sentences for impact. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong expression of disbelief and sarcasm.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone but falls short in several areas. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Ampun deh,* reaksi instan dan terdiam saya"" is a bit awkward. ""Ampun deh"" is a common Indonesian expression, but it doesn't quite convey the same level of dismissive sarcasm as ""my ass."" ""Reaksi instan dan terdiam saya"" is grammatically correct but lacks the punch of the original. ""Terdiam"" implies silence, which isn't the primary point; the reaction is more about disbelief.

The translation of ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" is also somewhat clunky. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" is understandable but lacks the natural flow of the original. The phrasing is too literal.

""Intent face"" is translated as ""wajah tegang petugas polisi itu."" While ""tegang"" (tense) is accurate, it doesn't capture the nuance of ""intent,"" which implies a focused, perhaps even intimidating, expression.

The translation of ""No suicide here"" as ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" is accurate but lacks the directness of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""Suicide, my ass"": Needs a more impactful and sarcastic equivalent. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid!) or ""Bunuh diri? Masa sih!"" (Suicide? Seriously!).
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me..."":  A more natural phrasing would be ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to check his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?).
*   ""Intent face"": Consider ""wajah yang serius"" (serious face) or ""wajah yang menatap tajam"" (a face that stares sharply) to better convey the feeling of the original.
*   ""No suicide here"": ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini"" is correct, but ""Bukan bunuh diri!"" (It's not suicide!) would be more direct and impactful.

* ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar bebasnya"" is too literal. Consider ""pacar yang agak nakal"" (a somewhat naughty girlfriend) or ""pacar yang tidak konvensional"" (an unconventional girlfriend) to better convey the implied rebellious nature.
* ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""Wajah serius wakil polisi itu"" is a bit bland.

The source text employs a cynical, slightly sarcastic tone. The language is informal and direct, using colloquialisms (""my ass"") to convey disbelief and frustration. The style is straightforward and focuses on conveying information efficiently. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that Dell Teague committed suicide and believes he was murdered. The text establishes a sense of mystery and impending investigation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and naturalness of the original. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is translated as ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira!"". While the meaning is conveyed, it feels somewhat clunky and less impactful than the original. The use of ""Jangan kira!"" is a bit too literal and doesn't capture the dismissive, almost defiant tone of the English phrase.

The sentence ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" is translated as ""Kenapa Sybil tidak memintaku untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, alih-alih mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?"". This is grammatically correct, but the phrasing is a bit stiff. ""Memeriksa makamnya dulu"" is a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the casual frustration of the original.

""Intent face"" is translated as ""wajah serius"". While ""serius"" is accurate, ""intent"" implies a focused, determined look, which isn't fully captured.

""Deputy"" is translated as ""wakil polisi"". This is a standard translation, but perhaps ""perwira polisi"" might be a more natural fit depending on the context and the specific role of the officer.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases and potential alternatives:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Jangan kira!"" Alternatives: ""Bisa suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, nggak?"" (Could you have asked me to check the grave first, or not?) or ""Nggak mungkin bunuh diri!"" (No way he committed suicide!) - these options are more colloquial and reflect the original's tone.
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak memintaku untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, alih-alih mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" Alternatives: ""Kenapa nggak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, daripada nyuruh aku cari Teenie di hutan?"" (Why didn't you ask me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to find Teenie in the woods?) - this is more conversational.

(using ""alih-alih"" instead of ""daripada"" for a slightly more sophisticated feel) or ""Bukankah lebih masuk akal kalau Sybil memintaku untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (Isn't it more logical if Sybil asked me to check the grave first?)
* ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar bebasnya"" is too literal. Consider ""pacar yang agak nakal"" (a somewhat naughty girlfriend) or ""pacar yang tidak konvensional"" (an unconventional girlfriend) to better convey the implied rebellious nature.
* ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""Wajah serius wakil polisi itu"" is a bit bland. Consider ""Ekspresi wajah wakil polisi itu menunjukkan bahwa dia sedang curiga"" (The deputy's facial expression showed that he was suspicious) or ""Wajah wakil polisi itu menunjukkan bahwa dia sedang menyelidiki"" (The deputy's face showed that he was investigating).

The translation needs revision. It lacks the punch, cynicism, and stylistic flair of the original. The phrasing is often too literal and lacks the natural flow of the English text. Specific improvements are needed to better capture the tone and implied meanings of several phrases.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective character's internal monologue. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""Omong kosong""). The style is straightforward and focuses on conveying information efficiently. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide and believes foul play was involved. The text establishes a sense of mystery and the narrator's sharp, observant personality.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. While ""Omong kosong"" means nonsense, it doesn't carry the same level of contempt or disbelief as the English idiom. The sentence structure is also a bit clunky in Indonesian. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less impactful than the original. The phrase ""pacar pemberontaknya"" is a literal translation of ""wild girlfriend"" and is not the most natural way to express this idea in Indonesian. A more idiomatic translation would be preferable. ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu"" is also a bit stiff. ""Intent"" in the original implies a focused and determined expression, which is not fully conveyed by ""serius.""

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" - Needs a more impactful and idiomatic translation. Consider options like: ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh,"" ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin,"" or ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong belaka."" The best choice depends on the specific nuance the translator wants to convey.
2. ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - This is grammatically correct but lacks flow. A more natural phrasing could be: ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?""
3. ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar pemberontaknya"" - While accurate, it's not the most natural. Consider: ""pacar yang sulit,"" ""pacar yang eksentrik,"" or even a more descriptive phrase like ""pacar yang penuh masalah.""
4. ""intent face"" -> ""wajah serius"" - ""Serius"" is too bland. Consider: ""wajah yang fokus,"" ""wajah yang penuh perhitungan,"" or ""wajah yang tajam.""

The source text employs a cynical and informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass""), contractions (""hadn't""), and a direct, conversational style. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and is investigating a murder. The style is active and uses short sentences for impact. The phrase ""my ass"" is used as a strong expression of disbelief.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone with ""Sialan,"" which is a suitable equivalent for ""my ass"" in terms of expressing disbelief. However, the translation loses some of the bluntness and impact of the original. The sentence structure is generally accurate, but some phrasing feels slightly unnatural in Indonesian.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases:

* ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? *Sialan*."" While ""Sialan"" works, it's a bit mild. Consider ""Bunuh diri? *Sial!*"" or even ""Bunuh diri? *Tidak mungkin!*"" to better convey the strong disbelief. Another option could be ""Bunuh diri? *Jangan bodoh!*"" to reflect the narrator's dismissive attitude.
* ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" This is grammatically correct but a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing could be: ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" or ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya duluan, bukannya mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" The use of ""terlebih dahulu"" or ""duluan"" makes the sentence flow more smoothly.
* ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah yang penuh perhitungan itu."" While accurate, ""penuh perhitungan"" is a bit formal. Consider ""Saya menatap wajah yang dingin itu"" (cold face) or ""Saya menatap wajah yang serius itu"" (serious face) to better reflect the deputy's intent demeanor.
* ""No suicide here,"" I said. -> ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku. This is perfectly fine and accurate.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass"") and a direct, matter-of-fact style. The meaning is clear: the narrator is skeptical of the initial assumption that Dell Teague committed suicide and believes he was murdered. The text also establishes a dynamic between the narrator and Deputy Hollis Boxleitner, hinting at a professional relationship. The use of ""playboy"" to describe Dell Teague's girlfriend adds a layer of characterization.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the core meaning but misses several nuances in tone and style. The translation of ""*Suicide, my ass*"" as ""*Sial!*"" is a significant misstep. While ""sial"" can express frustration, it doesn't convey the same level of defiant disbelief and cynicism as the original phrase. It lacks the sarcastic bite. The phrase ""playboy"" is a direct translation and works, but it could be more evocative in Indonesian. The overall flow is acceptable, but the language feels somewhat stiff and lacks the naturalness of the original. The use of ""wakil"" for ""deputy"" is accurate but lacks the impact of a more descriptive term.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""*Suicide, my ass*"" -> ""*Sial!*"" : This is a poor translation. Consider alternatives that convey disbelief and sarcasm. For example, ""*Bisa suruh dia bunuh diri?*"" (Could he have just killed himself?) or ""*Nggak mungkin bunuh diri!*"" (No way he committed suicide!).
2. ""Of course this boy hadn't shot himself."" -> ""Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri."" This is grammatically correct but lacks the punch of the original. Consider: ""Tentu saja dia nggak bunuh diri."" (Of course, he didn't commit suicide.)
3. ""Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend."" -> ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar playboy-nya."" The use of ""playboy"" is acceptable, but it could be more descriptive. Consider: ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacarnya yang suka berpesta."" (Dell Teague was murdered, just like his party-loving girlfriend.) or ""pacarnya yang hidupnya serba mewah."" (his girlfriend who lived a luxurious life).
4. ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius itu milik wakil."" This is awkward. A better phrasing would be: ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil itu."" (I stared at the serious face of the deputy.) or ""Saya melihat wajah serius wakil itu."" (I saw the serious face of the deputy.)

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone. The phrase ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is a strong, dismissive expression. The style is direct and conversational, using contractions (""hadn't"") and colloquialisms (""playboy""). The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that Dell Teague died by suicide. The text establishes a mystery and hints at foul play.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the sarcasm with ""*sarkas!*"" which is a reasonable attempt, but it doesn't fully convey the intensity and dismissiveness of the original. The phrase ""Reaksi instan dan sunyi saya"" is a literal translation and lacks the punch of the original. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya datang ke sini untuk memeriksa mayatnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat clunky and less natural in Indonesian. The use of ""mayatnya"" (corpse) is a bit too direct and potentially morbid for the tone. ""Pacar playboy-nya"" is a literal translation of ""wild girlfriend"" and doesn't quite capture the implied meaning of a woman who is perhaps promiscuous or unconventional. ""Wajah serius wakil itu"" is a correct translation of ""intent face of the deputy"" but lacks the nuance of the original. ""Tidak mungkin bunuh diri di sini"" is a literal translation of ""No suicide here"" and is grammatically correct, but it doesn't have the same impact as the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""*Suicide, my ass*"" -> ""*sarkas!*"" - While ""sarkas"" means sarcasm, it doesn't carry the same weight of disbelief and dismissal as the original. A better option might be something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!*"" (Suicide? Don't be foolish!) or ""*Sudah kubilang, bunuh diri?*"" (I already said, suicide?) to convey the narrator's exasperation.
*   ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya datang ke sini untuk memeriksa mayatnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" - This is too literal. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa tempat kejadian dulu, daripada mengirim saya mencari Teenie di hutan?"" (Why didn't Sybil tell me to check the scene first, instead of sending me to look for Teenie in the woods?).
*   ""Pacar playboy-nya"" - This is a literal translation and doesn't capture the intended meaning. Consider: ""pacar yang hidupnya bebas"" (a girlfriend who lives freely) or ""pacar yang agak... bebas"" (a girlfriend who is a bit... free), depending on the desired level of subtlety.
*   ""Wajah serius wakil itu"" - Consider: ""Ekspresi serius wakil itu"" (The serious expression of the deputy) or ""Wajah wakil itu menunjukkan keseriusan"" (The deputy's face showed seriousness).

*Suicide, my ass*, was my instant, and silent, reaction. Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie? Of course this boy hadn't shot himself. Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend. I opened my eyes. Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing. I looked into the intent face of the deputy. ""No suicide here,"" I said.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass"") and a direct, matter-of-fact style. The meaning is clear: the narrator is skeptical of the initial assumption that Dell Teague committed suicide and believes he was murdered. The text also establishes a dynamic between the narrator and Deputy Hollis Boxleitner, hinting at a professional relationship. The use of ""playboy"" to describe Dell Teague's girlfriend adds a layer of characterization.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the core meaning but misses several nuances in tone and style. The translation of ""*Suicide, my ass*"" as ""*Sial!*"" is a significant misstep. While ""sial"" can express frustration, it doesn't convey the same level of defiant disbelief and cynicism as the original phrase. It lacks the sarcastic bite. The phrase ""playboy"" is a direct translation and works, but it could be more evocative in Indonesian. The overall flow is acceptable, but the language feels somewhat stiff and lacks the naturalness of the original. The use of ""wakil"" for ""deputy"" is accurate but lacks the impact of a more descriptive term.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""*Suicide, my ass*"" -> ""*Sial!*"" : This is a poor translation. Consider alternatives that convey disbelief and sarcasm. For example, ""*Bisa suruh dia bunuh diri?*"" (Could he have just killed himself?) or ""*Nggak mungkin bunuh diri!*"" (No way he committed suicide!).
2. ""Of course this boy hadn't shot himself."" -> ""Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri."" This is grammatically correct but lacks the punch of the original. Consider: ""Tentu saja dia nggak bunuh diri."" (Of course, he didn't commit suicide.)
3. ""Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend."" -> ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar playboy-nya."" The use of ""playboy"" is acceptable, but it could be more descriptive. Consider: ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacarnya yang suka berpesta."" (Dell Teague was murdered, just like his party-loving girlfriend.) or ""pacarnya yang hidupnya serba mewah."" (his girlfriend who lived a luxurious life).
4. ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius itu milik wakil."" This is awkward. A better phrasing would be: ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil itu."" (I stared at the serious face of the deputy.) or ""Saya melihat wajah serius wakil itu."" (I saw the serious face of the deputy.)

The source text employs a cynical and informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass""), contractions (""hadn't""), and a direct, almost terse style. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is skeptical about the initial assumption of suicide and is investigating a murder. The style is conversational and reflects the narrator's personality – sharp, observant, and somewhat dismissive. The use of italics emphasizes the narrator's disbelief.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the informal tone with ""Sialan,"" which is a reasonable attempt to convey the disbelief expressed by ""my ass."" However, the translation loses some of the bluntness and impact of the original. The phrase ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa tempat kejadian dulu"" is grammatically correct but sounds slightly formal and less natural than the original. ""Tempat kejadian"" is a bit clunky; a more natural phrasing might be preferable. The translation of ""wild girlfriend"" as ""pacar playboy-nya"" is a bit awkward. While ""playboy"" conveys a sense of a woman who dates someone with a reputation for being a womanizer, it doesn't fully capture the original's implication of a more unconventional or perhaps even dangerous relationship. ""Wajah serius wakil itu"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy"" and doesn't quite convey the subtle nuance of the original. ""Intent"" in this context implies a focused, determined, and perhaps even slightly menacing look.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases and potential alternatives:

*   ""*Suicide, my ass*"" -> ""*Sialan*"" is acceptable, but consider ""*Bisa suruh bunuh diri?*"" (Could he have committed suicide?) to better capture the incredulity. Alternatively, ""*Nggak mungkin bunuh diri*"" (No way he committed suicide) is more colloquial.
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa tempat kejadian dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" Consider: ""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh aku lihat dulu makamnya, daripada nyuruh aku cari Teenie di hutan?"" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to find Teenie in the woods?) This is more conversational.
*   ""Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend."" -> ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar playboy-nya."" Consider: ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacarnya yang agak... unik."" (Dell Teague was murdered, just like his girlfriend who was a bit... unusual.) This avoids the potentially loaded term ""playboy"" and maintains the sense of an unconventional relationship.
*   ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil itu."" Consider: ""Saya melihat ke wajah wakil itu, yang terlihat sangat serius."" (I looked at the deputy's face, which looked very serious.) or ""Saya menatap wajah wakil itu, yang tampak penuh perhitungan."" (I stared at the deputy's face, which seemed calculating.)

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal but also emotionally charged, particularly in the phrases ""confidence trickster"" and ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and direct, using relatively simple language but with impactful word choices. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's wit, cleverness, or ability to think quickly, and ""impugn our honor"" means to attack or discredit their reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone than the original.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While accurate, it might be better to convey the feeling of being underestimated or mocked rather than outright accused of being a con artist. ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a little unnatural. A more natural phrasing would be ""bahkan Tolliver lebih tidak suka"" (even Tolliver dislikes it more).

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku."" - ""Kesadaran"" (consciousness) is not the best translation for ""quick"" in this context. ""Kesadaran"" implies a higher level of awareness than the intended meaning. A better translation would be ""pikiran"" (mind) or ""cerdas"" (cleverness/wit). ""Menyentuh kesadaranku"" (touch my consciousness) is also a bit too literal. ""Menyentuh pikiranku"" (touch my mind) or ""mengganggu kecerdasanku"" (interfere with my cleverness) would be more appropriate.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the feeling of being personally attacked. A more natural and impactful translation would be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He is very upset when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang merendahkan kami"" (He is very upset when people belittle us).

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to wit or cleverness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's intelligence or integrity questioned. ""Confidence trickster"" implies being accused of deception or manipulation, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and character. The phrase ""don't let them touch my quick"" is figurative, meaning the speaker is protecting their cleverness and sharp wit from being exploited or undermined.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. ""Orang yang bodoh"" (a foolish person) is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster"" but doesn't capture the intended meaning of being perceived as deceptive or manipulative. ""Mengganggu pikiranku"" (disturbing my thoughts) is a somewhat awkward translation of ""don't let them touch my quick."" It doesn't convey the idea of protecting one's wit or cleverness. ""Mencemarkan nama baik kami"" (defaming our honor) is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it sounds overly formal and lacks the impact of the original. The repetition of ""dia"" (he) is also slightly clunky.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster"" -> ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang bodoh."" A better option would be ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" (I don't like being treated like someone who tries to deceive) or ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang tidak jujur"" (I don't like being treated like someone who is dishonest).
* ""I don't let them touch my quick"" -> ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka mengganggu pikiranku."" This is too literal and doesn't capture the figurative meaning. A more natural translation would be ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka mengejek kecerdasanku"" (I don't let them mock my intelligence) or ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka meremehkan akalku"" (I don't let them underestimate my wit).
* ""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor."" -> ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kami."" While grammatically correct, it lacks the punch of the original.

--- CONTEXT ---
Text type: fictional text, novel excerpt
Source Language: English
Target Language: Indonesian

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal but also emotionally charged, particularly in the phrases ""confidence trickster"" and ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and direct, using relatively simple language but with impactful word choices. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's wit, cleverness, or ability to think quickly, and ""impugn our honor"" means to attack or discredit their reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone than the original.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While accurate, it might be better to convey the feeling of being underestimated or mocked rather than outright accused of being a con artist. ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a little unnatural. A more natural phrasing would be ""bahkan Tolliver lebih tidak suka"" (even Tolliver dislikes it more).

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku."" - ""Kesadaran"" (consciousness) is not the best translation for ""quick"" in this context. ""Kesadaran"" implies a higher level of awareness than the intended meaning. A better translation would be ""pikiran"" (mind) or ""cerdas"" (cleverness/wit). ""Menyentuh kesadaranku"" (touch my consciousness) is also a bit too literal. ""Menyentuh pikiranku"" (touch my mind) or ""mengganggu kecerdasanku"" (interfere with my cleverness) would be more appropriate.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the feeling of being personally attacked. A more natural and impactful translation would be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He is very upset when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang merendahkan kami"" (He is very upset when people belittle us).

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The phrasing in several parts is too literal and lacks the natural flow and emotional impact of the original. Specifically, the translation of ""quick"" and ""impugn our honor"" needs to be rethought to better reflect the intended meaning and tone. The overall sentence structure could also be adjusted for a more natural Indonesian reading experience.

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal, yet the language is direct and emotionally charged. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or quick wit. The overall style is relatively straightforward, using clear and concise language.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally understandable, but it suffers from several issues in terms of naturalness and accuracy.

1. ""penipu ulung"" - While ""penipu ulung"" translates to ""master swindler,"" it's a bit too strong and doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""confidence trickster."" ""Confidence trickster"" implies a more subtle form of deception, relying on charm and manipulation rather than outright fraud. A better option might be ""orang yang suka memanfaatkan orang lain"" (someone who likes to take advantage of others) or ""orang yang mencoba menipu dengan licik"" (someone who tries to deceive cleverly).

2. ""akal ku"" - ""Akal ku"" literally translates to ""my wit"" or ""my intellect."" While understandable, it doesn't accurately convey the intended meaning of ""quick"" in this context. ""Quick"" here refers to someone's responsiveness, cleverness, or ability to think quickly on their feet. A more appropriate translation would be ""cerdikku"" (my cleverness) or ""kecepatan berpikirku"" (my quick thinking).

3. ""mencela kehormatan kami"" - ""Mencela"" means ""to slander"" or ""to defame."" While close to ""impugn,"" it lacks the formal and direct attack implied by ""impugn."" ""Menyerang kehormatan kami"" (to attack our honor) or ""merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (to belittle our honor) would be more suitable.

4. The repetition of ""itu"" (that) in ""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga"" feels slightly awkward. It could be rephrased for better flow.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to wit or cleverness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's intelligence or integrity questioned. ""Confidence trickster"" implies being accused of deception or manipulation, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and character. The phrase ""don't let them touch my quick"" is figurative, meaning the speaker is protecting their cleverness and sharp wit from being exploited or undermined.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. ""Orang yang bodoh"" (a foolish person) is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster"" but doesn't capture the intended meaning of being perceived as deceptive or manipulative. ""Mengganggu pikiranku"" (disturbing my thoughts) is a somewhat awkward translation of ""don't let them touch my quick."" It doesn't convey the idea of protecting one's wit or cleverness. ""Mencemarkan nama baik kami"" (defaming our honor) is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it sounds overly formal and lacks the impact of the original. The repetition of ""dia"" (he) is also slightly clunky.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster"" -> ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang bodoh."" A better option would be ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" (I don't like being treated like someone who tries to deceive) or ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang tidak jujur"" (I don't like being treated like someone who is dishonest).
* ""I don't let them touch my quick"" -> ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka mengganggu pikiranku."" This is too literal and doesn't capture the figurative meaning. A more natural translation would be ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka mengejek kecerdasanku"" (I don't let them mock my intelligence) or ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka meremehkan akalku"" (I don't let them underestimate my wit).
* ""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor."" -> ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kami."" While grammatically correct, it lacks the punch of the original. Consider ""Dia sangat marah ketika orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He gets very angry when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat tersinggung ketika orang meragukan kehormatan kami"" (He gets very offended when people doubt our honor).

""Memanfaatkan kecerdikan saya"" is a literal translation of ""let them touch my quick,"" but it doesn't convey the intended meaning of wit or cleverness.

* ""I don't let them touch my quick"" -> ""Saya tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kecerdikan saya"" should be ""Saya tidak membiarkan mereka mengejek kecerdikanku"" (I don't let them mock my cleverness) or ""Saya tidak membiarkan mereka meremehkan kecerdikanku"" (I don't let them underestimate my cleverness). ""Memanfaatkan"" is too literal and doesn't convey the feeling of someone trying to provoke or challenge the speaker's intelligence. ""Quick"" here refers to quick wit, not physical agility.
* ""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor"" -> ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kami"" could be improved to ""Dia sangat marah ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He gets very angry when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat tersinggung ketika orang-orang meragukan kehormatan kami"" (He gets very offended when people doubt our honor).

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal but also emotionally charged, particularly with the phrase ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and uses relatively strong vocabulary (""confidence trickster,"" ""impugn""). The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or cleverness. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a direct attack on their reputation and character.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone compared to the original.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) feels a bit too strong. While accurate, it might not fully capture the nuance of ""confidence trickster,"" which implies a more subtle form of deception or manipulation. ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a little clunky.

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akalku."" - ""Menyentuh akalku"" (touch my wit/mind) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick,"" but it doesn't quite convey the intended meaning. ""Akal"" can mean wit, intelligence, or even a clever plan. A better translation would be something that implies exploitation of cleverness or vulnerabilities.

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good, straightforward translation.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng reputasi kita."" - ""Mencoreng reputasi kita"" (staining our reputation) is a reasonable translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it lacks the weight and formality of the original. ""Impugn"" suggests a more direct and forceful attack on one's character.

Here's a breakdown of suggested improvements:

1. ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" -> ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" (I don't like being treated like someone who tries to deceive, and I'm sure Tolliver hates it even more.) This is less strong but more accurate to the original meaning.

2. ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akalku."" -> ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kecerdasanku."" (I retreat into myself, and I don't let them exploit my intelligence.) This captures the sense of vulnerability and exploitation better.

3. ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng reputasi kita."" -> ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kita."" (He is very upset when people attack our reputation.) This is a stronger and more accurate translation of ""impugn.""

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to wit or cleverness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's intelligence or cleverness exploited. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a perceived manipulation or deception, even if the speaker doesn't believe they are actually deceiving anyone. ""Impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on their integrity and reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite capture the original's informal feel.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan bagai orang yang mencoba menipu"" - While accurate, ""diperlakukan bagai orang yang mencoba menipu"" is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" or even ""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai orang yang mencoba menipu."" The use of ""bagai"" is grammatically correct but less common in everyday speech.

""memanfaatkan kecerdasanku"" - This translation of ""touch my quick"" is too literal and doesn't convey the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to wit, cleverness, or quick thinking. A better translation would be ""memanfaatkan kecerdasanku"" or ""menggunakan kecerdasanku untuk keuntungan mereka"" (using my cleverness to their advantage). The current translation implies a more negative connotation of being exploited for intellectual ability.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kita"" - This is a relatively accurate translation, but ""menyerang reputasi kita"" is a bit formal. ""Menyerang"" implies a direct and aggressive attack. A more natural phrasing could be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kita"" (discredit our name) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang merendahkan kita"" (belittle us).

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akal cerdikku."" - ""Akal cerdikku"" (my cleverness) is a direct translation of ""my quick,"" but it sounds a bit formal and less impactful. A better option might be ""cerdasku"" (my wit/intelligence) or even a more figurative expression like ""pikiran cerdikku"" (my clever mind).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good translation and relatively natural.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang merendahkan kehormatan kami."" - ""Merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (to belittle our honor) is accurate, but ""merendahkan"" feels a bit strong. ""Mengejek kehormatan kami"" (to mock our honor) or ""menghina kehormatan kami"" (to insult our honor) might be more appropriate, depending on the specific nuance intended.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to improve the flow and naturalness of the Indonesian. Specifically, the phrases ""orang yang mencoba menipu"" and ""akal cerdikku"" sound unnatural. Consider using ""seolah-olah aku sedang ditipu"" or ""cerdasku"" instead. Also, explore alternatives to ""merendahkan kehormatan kami"" to better capture the feeling of being intellectually insulted.

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to wit or cleverness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's intelligence or reputation questioned. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a perception of being deceived or manipulated, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on their integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally understandable, but it misses nuances in meaning and tone. ""Meremehkan kecerdasanku"" (belittling my intelligence) is a literal translation of ""let them touch my quick,"" but it doesn't capture the idiomatic meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to quick wit, cleverness, or sharpness of mind. ""Menyerang kehormatan kami"" (attacking our honor) is a reasonable translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it lacks the formality and weight of the original. The phrase ""bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward. The overall flow is a bit clunky and doesn't quite replicate the original's directness.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

*   ""Aku tidak suka merasa seperti sedang ditipu"" - While understandable, it lacks the sharpness of ""being treated like a confidence trickster."" Consider ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" (I don't like being treated like a master swindler) or ""Aku tidak suka merasa seperti sedang dimanfaatkan"" (I don't like feeling exploited).
*   ""meremehkan kecerdasanku"" - This is a literal translation and doesn't convey the idiomatic meaning of ""let them touch my quick."" A better option would be ""meremehkan kecerdikanku"" (belittling my cleverness) or ""meremehkan akalku"" (belittling my wit).
*   ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang kehormatan kami"" - While accurate, ""menyerang kehormatan kami"" is a bit weak. Consider ""menuduh kami tidak jujur"" (accusing us of dishonesty) or ""meragukan integritas kami"" (questioning our integrity) to better reflect the original's sense of a direct attack.
*   ""bahkan lebih membencinya"" - This phrase is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural. Consider ""dia bahkan lebih membencinya"" (he even hates it more) or ""dia sangat membencinya, bahkan lebih dari itu"" (he hates it very much, even more than that).

The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's intelligence or cleverness exploited.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seolah-olah aku sedang ditipu, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""diperlakukan seolah-olah"" is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing might be ""Aku tidak suka merasa seperti sedang ditipu, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" (I don't like *feeling* like I'm being tricked...).

""Aku menarik diri dan tidak membiarkan mereka mengusik kecerdasanku."" - ""Mengusik kecerdasanku"" is not quite right. ""Kecerdasan"" is a bit too literal. A better option would be ""Aku menarik diri dan tidak membiarkan mereka meremehkan/mengejek kecerdasanku."" (I retreat and don't let them belittle/mock my intelligence). Alternatively, ""mengusik"" (to bother, to tease) is not the best fit for the context of someone's intelligence.

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is acceptable, but a more natural phrasing could be ""Tolliver juga mencoba, tapi kurang berhasil."" (Tolliver also tries, but is less successful).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menghina reputasi kami."" - ""Menghina reputasi kami"" is accurate, but ""impugn our honor"" carries a stronger connotation of a direct attack on character and integrity than simply ""menghina reputasi."" Consider ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang kehormatan kami."" (He is very upset when people attack our honor).

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of anger and resentment. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to manipulate or exploit them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, but it sounds a bit clunky and less impactful than the original. While ""penipu"" means ""trickster"" or ""swindler,"" ""ulung"" emphasizes skill or expertise in trickery, which isn't quite the same as the implied deliberate deception in the original. ""Inti saya"" is a literal translation of ""quick,"" which is a figurative term for vulnerabilities or sensitive points. It doesn't capture the figurative meaning effectively. ""Mencoreng nama baik kita"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and could be phrased more naturally. The repetition of ""dia"" (he) is also slightly awkward.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases:

*   ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster"" -> ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" could be improved to ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu."" (I don't like being treated like someone who tries to deceive.) This is more natural and conveys the intended meaning more clearly.
*   ""I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick"" -> ""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh inti saya."" could be improved to ""Saya menarik diri dan melindungi diri, tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kelemahan saya."" (I withdraw and protect myself, not letting them exploit my weaknesses.) This captures the figurative meaning of ""quick"" better.
*   ""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor"" -> ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng nama baik kita."" could be improved to ""Dia sangat marah ketika orang menyerang reputasi kita."" (He gets very angry when people attack our reputation.) ""Menyerang reputasi"" is a more common and natural way to express the idea of impugning someone's honor.

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to one's vulnerabilities or weaknesses). The style is straightforward and conversational. The meaning centers around the speaker's discomfort with being exploited or taken advantage of, and Tolliver's similar aversion to having his reputation questioned. ""Impugn our honor"" is a slightly formal way of saying ""question our honor"" or ""attack our reputation."" The phrase ""manipulate my quick"" is figurative, implying an attempt to exploit the speaker's vulnerabilities.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. ""Orang yang mencoba menipu"" is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster"" and sounds somewhat clunky in Indonesian.

* ""memanfaatkan saya"" - This is a bit too literal. Consider ""menggunakan kelemahan saya"" (using my weaknesses) or ""mengeksploitasi saya"" (exploiting me) to better convey the sense of vulnerability being targeted.
* ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita"" - While accurate, ""mencemarkan nama baik"" is quite formal.

I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to vulnerability or weakness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling exploited and having one's integrity challenged. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a perceived deception, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and character. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression indicating vulnerability or exploitation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. ""Orang yang mencoba menipu"" is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster"" and sounds somewhat clunky in Indonesian. A more idiomatic translation would be preferable. ""Melindungi diri"" is a bit vague; ""tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kelemahan saya"" is more descriptive but less concise. ""Kelemahan saya"" is a direct translation of ""quick"" but doesn't fully capture the intended meaning. ""Menyerang reputasi kita"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it could be strengthened. The overall flow is acceptable, but the phrasing could be refined to better reflect the original's tone and style.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" - Consider alternatives like ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu"" or ""Saya tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu."" The current phrasing is a bit wordy.
2. ""tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kelemahan saya"" - While accurate, this is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing could be ""tidak membiarkan mereka mengeksploitasi saya"" or ""tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan saya.""
3. ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kita"" - While grammatically correct, ""menyerang reputasi kita"" is a bit passive. Consider ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita"" or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang merendahkan kita.""

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The phrasing is too literal in several places and lacks the natural flow of Indonesian. The use of more idiomatic expressions and a slightly more informal tone would improve the translation's quality and better reflect the original text's nuances. Specifically, focus on replacing overly literal translations with more natural Indonesian equivalents and consider using stronger verbs to convey the intended meaning more effectively.

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to vulnerability or a weakness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling exploited and having one's integrity challenged. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a perceived deception, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and character. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression for being emotionally vulnerable or exploited.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. ""Diperlakukan seperti sedang ditipu"" is a literal translation of ""treated like a confidence trickster,"" but it sounds slightly awkward in Indonesian. A more idiomatic translation would be preferable. ""Kelemahan saya"" (my weakness) is a direct translation of ""my quick,"" but it doesn't capture the figurative meaning. ""Menyentuh kelemahan saya"" is also a bit too literal and doesn't flow well. ""Merendahkan kehormatan kami"" is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and could be phrased more naturally. The overall sentence structure is correct, but the word choices feel somewhat clunky and don't fully convey the original's emotional intensity.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

* ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti sedang ditipu"": Consider alternatives like ""Saya tidak suka merasa dipermainkan"" (I don't like feeling played) or ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang bodoh"" (I don't like being treated like a fool), depending on the specific context. The original implies a feeling of being taken advantage of, not necessarily a literal deception.
* ""Menyentuh kelemahan saya"": This is too literal. Consider ""memanfaatkan kerentanan saya"" (exploiting my vulnerability) or ""mengusik perasaan rapuh saya"" (disturbing my fragile feelings).
* ""Merendahkan kehormatan kami"": While grammatically correct, it's overly formal. A more natural phrasing could be ""menghina reputasi kami"" (insulting our reputation) or ""mencoba mencoreng nama baik kami"" (trying to tarnish our good name).

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to one's vulnerabilities or weaknesses). The style is straightforward and conversational. The meaning centers around the speaker's discomfort with being exploited or taken advantage of, and Tolliver's similar aversion to having his reputation questioned. ""Impugn our honor"" is a slightly formal way of saying ""question our honor"" or ""attack our reputation."" The phrase ""manipulate my quick"" is figurative, implying an attempt to exploit the speaker's vulnerabilities.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. ""Orang yang mencoba menipu"" is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster"" and sounds somewhat clunky in Indonesian. ""Memanfaatkan saya"" is a decent translation of ""touch my quick,"" but it doesn't fully capture the figurative meaning of vulnerability being exploited. ""Mencemarkan nama baik kita"" is a valid translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and doesn't quite match the informal tone of the original. The sentence structure is also a bit stiff in places.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" - Consider alternatives that are more idiomatic. For example, ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti sedang ditipu"" (I don't like being treated as if I'm being tricked) or ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang bodoh"" (I don't like being treated like a fool) depending on the intended emphasis.
* ""memanfaatkan saya"" - This is a bit too literal. Consider ""menggunakan kelemahan saya"" (using my weaknesses) or ""mengeksploitasi saya"" (exploiting me) to better convey the sense of vulnerability being targeted.
* ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita"" - While accurate, ""mencemarkan nama baik"" is quite formal. A more natural alternative could be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kita"" (He's very upset when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang merendahkan kita"" (He's very upset when people belittle us).

""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression for being emotionally vulnerable or exploited. ""Impugn our honor"" is a formal way of saying to attack someone's reputation or integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Saya tidak suka merasa dipermainkan, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - This is a good start, but ""dipermainkan"" (being played) is a bit generic. It doesn't fully capture the feeling of being tricked or deceived. A better option might be ""Saya tidak suka merasa diperlakukan seperti orang yang ditipu, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" (I don't like feeling treated like someone who is deceived, and I'm sure Tolliver dislikes it even more.)

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan saya tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh sisi rentan saya."" - This is a decent translation of ""retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick."" However, ""sisi rentan saya"" (my vulnerable side) is a bit too literal and lacks the impact of the original. ""Sisi rentan"" is understandable but doesn't carry the same emotional weight. A more natural phrasing could be ""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan saya tidak mengizinkan mereka memanfaatkan kelemahan saya."" (I retreat inside myself, and I don't allow them to exploit my weakness.) Alternatively, ""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan saya tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh titik lemah saya."" (I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my weak point.)

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is accurate, but ""kurang berhasil"" is a bit weak. Consider ""tetapi dia tidak seberhasil saya"" (but he is not as successful as I am) or ""tetapi dia kurang berhasil seperti saya"" (but he is less successful than I am).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencurigai integritas kami."" - ""Mencurigai integritas kami"" is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the intensity of the original. ""Mencurigai integritas kami"" is accurate, but it lacks the forceful connotation of ""impugn."" A better option would be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He is very upset when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang meragukan kehormatan kami.""

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite capture the original's informal feel.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit too strong. While accurate, it lacks the nuance of ""confidence trickster,"" which implies a more subtle form of deception or manipulation.

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya."" - ""menyentuh saraf saya"" (touch my nerves) is a literal translation and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to nerves, sensitivity, or emotional core. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh perasaan saya"" (touch my feelings) or ""mengganggu sensitivitas saya"" (disturb my sensitivity).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita."" - ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" (defame our reputation) is accurate but a bit formal. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a more direct and personal attack on character.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. ""Seolah-olah saya ditipu"" (as if I'm being tricked) is a literal translation of ""like a confidence trickster"" and doesn't fully capture the intended meaning of being treated *as if* one is a trickster, implying a perception of being unfairly accused. ""Mengganggu sensitivitas saya"" (disturbing my sensitivities) is a somewhat awkward phrasing for ""let them touch my quick."" It doesn't convey the same visceral feeling of vulnerability. ""Menyerang kehormatan kita"" (attacking our honor) is a correct translation, but it's a bit formal and could be phrased more naturally. The repetition of ""dia"" (he) is also slightly clunky.

1. ""Saya tidak suka merasa seolah-olah saya ditipu"": While accurate, it lacks the subtle implication of being unfairly labeled. Consider alternatives like ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" (I don't like being treated like a master swindler) or ""Saya tidak suka merasa dituduh sebagai penipu"" (I don't like feeling accused of being a trickster).
2. ""Mengganggu sensitivitas saya"": This is too literal and doesn't capture the figurative meaning. Consider ""mengusik kelemahan saya"" (troubling my weaknesses) or ""memanfaatkan kerentanan saya"" (exploiting my vulnerabilities).

--- CONTEXT ---
Text type: fictional text, novel excerpt
Source Language: English
Target Language: Indonesian

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and emotional vulnerability. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to nerves or sensitivity) and ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and the discomfort of having one's vulnerabilities exploited. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a perception of being deceived or manipulated, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite capture the original's informal feel.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit too strong. While accurate, it lacks the nuance of ""confidence trickster,"" which implies a more subtle form of deception or manipulation. ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""bahkan lebih tidak suka.""

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya."" - ""menyentuh saraf saya"" (touch my nerves) is a literal translation and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to nerves, sensitivity, or emotional core. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh perasaan saya"" (touch my feelings) or ""mengganggu sensitivitas saya"" (disturb my sensitivity).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita."" - ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" (defame our reputation) is accurate but a bit formal. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a more direct and personal attack on character. A more suitable translation could be ""ketika orang menyerang kehormatan kita"" (when people attack our honor) or ""ketika orang merendahkan kita"" (when people belittle us).

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to better capture the informal tone and nuanced meaning of the original. Specifically:

1.  Replace ""penipu ulung"" with a phrase that conveys the subtle deception implied by ""confidence trickster,"" such as ""seolah-olah saya ditipu"" (as if I've been tricked) or ""seolah-olah saya sedang dimanipulasi"" (as if I'm being manipulated).
2.  Replace ""menyentuh saraf saya"" with a phrase that reflects emotional sensitivity, such as ""menyentuh perasaan saya"" or ""mengganggu sensitivitas saya.""
3.  Replace ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" with a phrase that conveys a direct attack on character, such as ""menyerang kehormatan kita"" or ""merendahkan kita.""

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and vulnerability. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to a person's vulnerabilities or weaknesses).

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) feels a bit too strong. ""Penipu"" (swindler) is more common and might be a better fit depending on the context. The phrase ""bahkan lebih tidak suka"" (even less like) is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing might be ""bahkan Tolliver lebih tidak menyukainya.""

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka mengusik kelemahan saya."" - ""Mengusik kelemahan saya"" is a literal translation of ""touch my quick,"" but it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's vulnerabilities or weaknesses, a sensitive spot. A better translation would be something like ""mengganggu bagian yang paling rentan dalam diri saya"" (disturb the most vulnerable part of myself) or ""mengusik sisi lemah saya"" (trouble my weak side).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi kurang berhasil."" - This is a good translation and acceptable.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kita."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kita"" (blemish our honor) is accurate, but ""impugn our honor"" implies a more direct and malicious attack. Consider using a phrase like ""menuduh kita melakukan kesalahan"" (accuse us of wrongdoing) or ""merusak reputasi kita"" (damage our reputation) to better reflect the original meaning.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of vulnerability. The meaning revolves around feeling manipulated and having one's integrity questioned. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit one's vulnerabilities or sensitive points. The style is relatively straightforward and uses clear, concise language.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. ""Seolah-olah saya ditipu"" (as if I'm being tricked) is a literal translation of ""like a confidence trickster"" and doesn't fully capture the intended meaning of being treated *as if* one is a trickster, implying a perception of being unfairly accused. ""Mengganggu sensitivitas saya"" (disturbing my sensitivities) is a somewhat awkward phrasing for ""let them touch my quick."" It doesn't convey the same visceral feeling of vulnerability. ""Menyerang kehormatan kita"" (attacking our honor) is a correct translation, but it's a bit formal and could be phrased more naturally. The repetition of ""dia"" (he) is also slightly clunky.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Saya tidak suka merasa seolah-olah saya ditipu"": While accurate, it lacks the subtle implication of being unfairly labeled. Consider alternatives like ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" (I don't like being treated like a master swindler) or ""Saya tidak suka merasa dituduh sebagai penipu"" (I don't like feeling accused of being a trickster).
2. ""Mengganggu sensitivitas saya"": This is too literal and doesn't capture the figurative meaning. Consider ""mengusik kelemahan saya"" (troubling my weaknesses) or ""memanfaatkan kerentanan saya"" (exploiting my vulnerabilities).
3. ""Menyerang kehormatan kita"": While grammatically correct, it's a bit stiff. Consider ""merendahkan kehormatan kita"" (belittling our honor) or ""mengancam reputasi kita"" (threatening our reputation).

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of anger and resentment. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or cleverness. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to undermine them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone than the original. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, but it sounds a bit clunky in Indonesian. While understandable, it doesn't capture the nuance of the original. ""Keunggulan"" translates ""quick"" literally, which is not the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to cleverness, wit, or a sharp mind – a vulnerability that someone might exploit. ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and lacks the directness of the original. The sentence structure is also slightly convoluted in places.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

*   ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" - While accurate, consider alternatives that convey the feeling of being unfairly labeled. For example, ""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu ulung"" (I don't like being *considered* a confidence trickster) or ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seolah-olah aku penipu ulung"" (I don't like being treated *as if* I'm a confidence trickster).
*   ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh keunggulanku."" - ""Keunggulan"" is not the right word. Consider ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kecerdasanku/kelicikanku/kemampuanku"" (I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them exploit my intelligence/cunning/abilities). The best choice depends on the specific context.
*   ""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is fine, but could be slightly more natural. ""Tolliver juga mencoba, tetapi kurang berhasil"" is a more common phrasing.
*   ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - This is a good translation, but consider ""Dia sangat marah ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He is very angry when people attack our reputation) for a slightly more direct and impactful tone.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and resentment. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to wit or cleverness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling exploited and having one's intelligence or cleverness taken advantage of. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a perceived manipulation or deception, even if the speaker doesn't believe they are actually deceiving anyone. ""Impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally understandable but lacks nuance and naturalness.

""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu, dan yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less."" The phrase ""dianggap sebagai penipu"" (considered a trickster) is a literal translation and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning of being treated *as if* one is a trickster. It could be improved to reflect the feeling of being unfairly labeled. ""bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a bit awkward.

""Aku menutup diri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kelebihanku."" - ""I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick."" ""Menutup diri"" (closing oneself off) is a good translation of ""retreat inside myself."" However, ""memanfaatkan kelebihanku"" (exploit my strengths) is not a direct equivalent of ""touch my quick."" ""Quick"" in this context refers to wit, cleverness, or quick thinking. A more accurate translation would be something like ""memainkan akalku"" (play with my wit) or ""memaksa aku menggunakan akalku"" (force me to use my wit).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tapi kurang berhasil."" - ""Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful."" This is a fairly accurate translation.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika reputasinya dicemarkan orang lain."" - ""He gets very upset when people impugn our honor."" ""Reputasinya dicemarkan"" (his reputation is tarnished) is a reasonable translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it doesn't fully capture the sense of a direct attack on integrity. ""Honor"" is a complex concept. In this context, it refers to a person's moral standing and reputation for honesty and integrity. A better translation might be ""ketika orang lain menyerang reputasinya"" (when others attack his reputation) or ""ketika orang lain meragukan kejujurannya"" (when others doubt his honesty).

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural flow in Indonesian.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it captures the essence of ""confidence trickster,"" it might be too harsh. A more natural phrasing could be ""penipu"" (trickster) or ""orang yang suka menipu"" (someone who likes to trick). ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a bit redundant. It could be simplified to ""bahkan Tolliver lebih tidak suka"" (even Tolliver dislikes it more).

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akal cerdikku."" - ""Akal cerdikku"" (my cleverness) is a literal translation of ""quick"" but doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Akal"" can mean intellect or wit, but it doesn't have the same connotation of quickness or sharpness. A better option would be ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka mengganggu pikiranku/cerdasanku"" (I retreat into myself, and I don't let them bother my thoughts/intelligence).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This part is fine, but ""kurang berhasil"" is a bit bland. ""Tidak seberhasil"" (not as successful) would be a more natural and common way to express this.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (to stain our honor) is a bit formal and literary. While accurate, it doesn't quite match the informal tone of the original. A more natural alternative would be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He is very upset when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang merendahkan kami"" (He is very upset when people belittle us).

""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the general meaning but misses several nuances in tone and style. ""Dikalaui"" is a somewhat awkward and less natural way to express ""treated like."" While understandable, it lacks the punch of the original. ""Memainkan akalku"" is a literal translation of ""let them touch my quick,"" but it doesn't convey the intended meaning of having one's wit or cleverness exploited. It sounds more like someone is being tricked by a clever plan rather than having their inherent intelligence targeted. ""Menyerang reputasinya"" is a reasonable translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's less forceful and less idiomatic than the original. The overall flow is a bit clunky and doesn't quite capture the speaker's emotional state.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""Aku tidak suka dikalaui sebagai penipu"": ""Dikalaui"" is not a common or natural way to say ""treated like."" Consider alternatives like ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu"" (I don't like being treated like a swindler) or ""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu"" (I don't like being considered a swindler).
* ""Memainkan akalku"": This is a literal translation and doesn't convey the intended meaning. Consider ""memanipulasi kecerdasanku"" (manipulate my intelligence) or ""menggunakan akal bulikku"" (use my quick wit) depending on the specific context.
* ""Menyerang reputasinya"": While accurate, it lacks the weight of ""impugn our honor."" Consider ""menuduh menghina kehormatan kami"" (accuse of insulting our honor) or ""merusak reputasi kami"" (damage our reputation).

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to wit or cleverness). The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly accused and a protective reaction to perceived attacks on one's character or intelligence. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a playful yet negative accusation of deception. ""Impugn our honor"" is a formal way of saying to attack someone's reputation or integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. The phrase ""mengganggu pikiranku"" (disturbing my thoughts) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" but doesn't capture the intended meaning of protecting one's wit or cleverness. ""Menyerang reputasi kami"" (attacking our reputation) is a decent translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's less formal and impactful. The overall flow is a bit clunky and doesn't quite replicate the original's directness.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

* ""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai orang yang suka menipu"" - While accurate, it's a bit verbose. A more concise and natural phrasing would be ""Aku tidak suka dicap sebagai penipu"" (I don't like being labeled a fraud). Alternatively, ""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai orang yang licik"" (I don't like being considered cunning/devious) could work, depending on the specific shade of meaning intended.
* ""mengganggu pikiranku"" - This is a literal translation and doesn't convey the intended meaning. Consider ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka meremehkan kecerdasanku"" (I don't let them belittle my intelligence) or ""Aku tidak membiarkan mereka meruntuhkan akal ku"" (I don't let them undermine my wit). The best option depends on whether the speaker wants to emphasize intelligence or cleverness.
* ""dia tidak seberhasil"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward. ""Dia kurang berhasil"" (He is less successful) is more natural.
* ""menyerang reputasi kami"" - While understandable, ""menyerang reputasi kami"" is a bit too direct and lacks the formality of ""impugn our honor."" Consider ""merusak kehormatan kami"" (damaging our honor) or ""menggoyahkan integritas kami"" (shaking our integrity), depending on the context.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""confidence trickster"" and ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and uses active voice. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Quick"" in this context refers to wit or cleverness, and ""impugn our honor"" means to attack or discredit their reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural flow in Indonesian.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it captures the essence of ""confidence trickster,"" it might be too harsh. A more natural phrasing could be ""penipu"" (trickster) or ""orang yang suka menipu"" (someone who likes to trick). ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a bit redundant. It could be simplified to ""bahkan Tolliver lebih tidak suka"" (even Tolliver dislikes it more).

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akal cerdikku."" - ""Akal cerdikku"" (my cleverness) is a literal translation of ""quick"" but doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Akal"" can mean intellect or wit, but it doesn't have the same connotation of quickness or sharpness. A better option would be ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka mengganggu pikiranku/cerdasanku"" (I retreat into myself, and I don't let them bother my thoughts/intelligence).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This part is fine, but ""kurang berhasil"" is a bit bland. ""Tidak seberhasil"" (not as successful) would be a more natural and common way to express this.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (to stain our honor) is a bit formal and literary. While accurate, it doesn't quite match the informal tone of the original. A more natural alternative would be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He is very upset when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang merendahkan kami"" (He is very upset when people belittle us).

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its natural flow and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" implies being far from people, which isn't the intended meaning of ""off the beaten road.""
2.  **""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya""**: The phrase ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the real log cabin) is grammatically correct but sounds a bit awkward. ""Pondok kayu asli"" (original log cabin) or ""pondok kayu sungguhan"" (real log cabin) would be more natural.
3.  **""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it."" A more idiomatic translation would be ""kamar mandi yang bersebelahan dengan dapur"" (the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen) or ""kamar mandi yang berada tepat di sebelah dapur"" (the bathroom right next to the kitchen).
4.  **Repetitive sentence structure**: The translation frequently uses similar sentence structures, making it sound monotonous. For example, many sentences begin with ""Akan ada..."" (There will be...). Varying the sentence structure would improve readability.
5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and doesn't fit the conversational tone. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural phrase like ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply implied.
6.  **""Untuk steak.""**: This is a very literal translation of ""For steaks."" It's grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (To grill steaks) or ""Agar bisa membuat steak.""

The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of phrases like ""of course"" and the slightly rambling nature of the description contribute to the informal tone.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the core meaning of the source text. However, it suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic fidelity.

1.  **""Jauh dari jalan utama"" (Far from the main road):** While accurate, this is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a secluded location) or ""di luar pusat kota"" (outside the city center), depending on the intended nuance. ""Jauh dari jalan utama"" sounds a bit literal and less idiomatic.

2.  **""Kesulitan yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu sungguhan"" (Difficulties that usually exist in a real log cabin):** This is a very literal translation and doesn't flow well in Indonesian. It's better to express the idea of inconveniences or drawbacks. For example, ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang sering terjadi pada pondok kayu"" (but without the problems often encountered with log cabins) or ""tetapi tanpa kekurangan pondok kayu"" (but without the drawbacks of a log cabin).

3.  **""Bersebelahan langsung dengan dapur"" (Directly adjacent to the kitchen):** This is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal. ""Berdekatan dengan dapur"" (close to the kitchen) or ""tepat di samping dapur"" (right next to the kitchen) would be more natural.

4.  **Repetitive use of ""di"" (at/in):** The phrase ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada..."" and ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur..."" uses ""di"" repeatedly, making the text sound monotonous. Varying the phrasing would improve the flow. For example, ""Di belakang rumah, akan ada..."" and ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur...""

5.  **""Tahu?"" (Know?):** While acceptable in informal conversation, it feels a bit too direct and less natural than a more subtle way of asking for confirmation. Consider replacing it with a more natural tag question like ""bukan?"" (right?) or simply omitting it.

6.  **""Untuk memanggang steak"" (For grilling steaks):** While understandable, ""memanggang steak"" is a bit formal. ""Memanggang daging steak"" (grilling steak meat) or simply ""steak"" would be more common and natural.

4.  **Repetitive sentence structure**: The translation frequently uses similar sentence structures, making it sound monotonous. For example, many sentences begin with ""Akan ada..."" (There will be...). Varying the sentence structure would improve readability.
5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and doesn't fit the conversational tone. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural phrase like ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply implied.
6.  **""Untuk steak.""**: This is a very literal translation of ""For steaks."" It's grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (To grill steaks) or ""Agar bisa membuat steak.""

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" and the slightly hesitant phrasing (""slowly,"" ""didn't talk about too often"") contribute to the natural, conversational feel. The inclusion of specific details like the *porte cochere* and gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - ""off the beaten road"" is better conveyed with something like ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" implies distance from a crowd, which isn't the intended meaning.
2. ""pondok kayu"" - While ""pondok kayu"" translates to ""log cabin,"" it lacks the charm and specific imagery of the original. Consider ""rumah bergaya pondok kayu"" (log cabin style house) or ""rumah dengan tampilan seperti pondok kayu"" (house with the appearance of a log cabin).
3. ""kesulitan yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu sungguhan"" - This is a clunky translation of ""inconveniences of a real log cabin."" It's overly literal and doesn't flow well in Indonesian. A better option would be ""kekurangan rumah kayu biasa"" (the drawbacks of a typical log cabin) or ""masalah yang sering dihadapi dengan rumah kayu"" (problems often encountered with log cabins).
4. ""mengicipi bir"" - This is a slightly awkward way to say ""taking a sip of beer."" ""Meneguk bir"" (taking a gulp of beer) or ""meminum bir"" (drinking beer) would be more natural.
5. ""kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal. ""Kamar mandi yang bersebelahan dengan dapur"" (the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen) or ""kamar mandi yang berada di samping dapur"" (the bathroom next to the kitchen) would be more natural.
6. ""Di bagian belakang"" - While not incorrect, it's a bit repetitive. ""Di belakang rumah"" (at the back of the house) would be more concise and natural.
7. ""tahu?"" - This is an informal tag question and is appropriate, but its overuse can feel unnatural. Consider removing it in some instances.
8. ""memanggang steak"" - While understandable, ""memanggang steak"" is a bit formal. ""Membuat steak"" (making steak) or ""memanggang daging steak"" (grilling steak) would be more common.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of phrases like ""of course"" and the slightly rambling nature of the description contribute to the informal tone.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the core meaning of the source text. However, it suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic fidelity.

1.  **""Jauh dari jalan utama"" (Far from the main road):** While accurate, this is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a secluded location) or ""di luar pusat kota"" (outside the city center), depending on the intended nuance. ""Jauh dari jalan utama"" sounds a bit literal and less idiomatic.

2.  **""Kesulitan yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu sungguhan"" (Difficulties that usually exist in a real log cabin):** This is a very literal translation and doesn't flow well in Indonesian. It's better to express the idea of inconveniences or drawbacks. For example, ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang sering terjadi pada pondok kayu"" (but without the problems often encountered with log cabins) or ""tetapi tanpa kekurangan pondok kayu"" (but without the drawbacks of a log cabin).

3.  **""Bersebelahan langsung dengan dapur"" (Directly adjacent to the kitchen):** This is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal. ""Berdekatan dengan dapur"" (close to the kitchen) or ""tepat di samping dapur"" (right next to the kitchen) would be more natural.

4.  **Repetitive use of ""di"" (at/in):** The phrase ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada..."" and ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur..."" uses ""di"" repeatedly, making the text sound monotonous. Varying the phrasing would improve the flow. For example, ""Di belakang rumah, akan ada..."" and ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur...""

5.  **""Tahu?"" (Know?):** While acceptable in informal conversation, it feels a bit too direct and less natural than a more subtle way of asking for confirmation. Consider replacing it with a more natural tag question like ""bukan?"" (right?) or simply omitting it.

6.  **""Untuk memanggang steak"" (For grilling steaks):** While understandable, ""memanggang steak"" is a bit formal. ""Memanggang daging steak"" (grilling steak meat) or simply ""steak"" would be more common and natural.

The translation needs revision. The issues primarily lie in the overly literal translations and the lack of natural flow. The translator should focus on conveying the meaning in a more idiomatic and conversational manner, avoiding direct translations that sound awkward in Indonesian.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari hiruk pikuk kota"" - While accurate, this is a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the casual tone of ""off the beaten road."" A better option would be something like ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place) or ""di luar pusat kota"" (outside the city center).

2. ""rumah panggung"" - This is a literal translation of ""log cabin"" and doesn't fully convey the intended image. While ""rumah panggung"" means ""stilt house,"" it doesn't necessarily evoke the rustic charm of a log cabin. Consider using ""rumah kayu bergaya kabin"" (a cabin-style wooden house) or ""rumah kayu sederhana"" (a simple wooden house).

3. ""ketidaknyamanan rumah panggung sungguhan"" - This is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan"" is a general term for inconvenience. A more natural phrasing would be ""kekurangan rumah panggung"" (the drawbacks of a log cabin) or ""masalah-masalah rumah panggung"" (the problems of a log cabin).

4. ""plus ruang keluarga"" - The use of ""plus"" is too formal for the conversational tone. ""dan"" (and) would be more appropriate.

5. ""tepat di sebelahnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""di sampingnya"" (beside it) would be more natural.

6. ""tahu?"" - While acceptable, this is a very informal way of asking ""see?"". A more natural and slightly less colloquial option would be ""kamu tahu?"" (do you know?) or simply omitting it.

7. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit awkward. ""Di sanalah perapian akan ada"" (The fireplace will be there) is more natural.

8. ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - The sentence structure is a bit awkward. It could be improved to ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can put a gas grill on the deck to grill steaks.)

The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, with the speaker painting a picture of their dream house. The meaning is straightforward: the speaker is describing the features of their ideal home, focusing on practical details and personal preferences. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost self-evident progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and realism.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian kota""**: While accurate, ""jauh dari keramaian kota"" (far from the city bustle) is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""di luar pusat kota"" (outside the city center) or ""di daerah yang tenang"" (in a quiet area). The original implies a rural or secluded location, not just distance from urban noise.
2.  **""masalah-masalah yang ada di kabin kayu sungguhan""**: This translation is overly literal. ""Inconveniences"" is better conveyed as ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings or drawbacks) or ""kesulitan"" (difficulties). The current phrasing sounds awkward and less elegant.
3.  **""kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is grammatically correct but lacks flow. ""tepat di sebelahnya"" (right next to it) is redundant. ""kamar mandi yang bersebelahan"" (the adjacent bathroom) or ""kamar mandi yang berada di samping dapur"" (the bathroom located beside the kitchen) would be smoother.
4.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is a bit stiff. ""Di sanalah"" (there) is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound formal. ""Di sana"" (there) is more natural.
5.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The frequent use of ""di"" (at/in) makes the text sound monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur,"" consider ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur.""
6.  **""tahu?""**: The use of ""tahu?"" (know?) is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone. A more appropriate phrase would be ""Anda mengerti?"" (Do you understand?) or simply omit it.
7.  **""Untuk memanggang steak""**: While understandable, ""memanggang steak"" is a bit formal. ""Membuat steak"" (to make steak) or ""memanggang steak"" (to grill steak) would be more natural.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and humor. The repetition of ""Of course"" emphasizes the narrator's certainty and enthusiasm.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari hiruk pikuk kota"" - While accurate, this is a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the casual tone of ""off the beaten road."" A better option would be something like ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place) or ""di luar pusat kota"" (outside the city center).

2. ""rumah panggung"" - This is a literal translation of ""log cabin"" and doesn't fully convey the intended image. While ""rumah panggung"" means ""stilt house,"" it doesn't necessarily evoke the rustic charm of a log cabin. Consider using ""rumah kayu bergaya kabin"" (a cabin-style wooden house) or ""rumah kayu sederhana"" (a simple wooden house).

3. ""ketidaknyamanan rumah panggung sungguhan"" - This is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan"" is a general term for inconvenience. A more natural phrasing would be ""kekurangan rumah panggung"" (the drawbacks of a log cabin) or ""masalah-masalah rumah panggung"" (the problems of a log cabin).

4. ""plus ruang keluarga"" - The use of ""plus"" is too formal for the conversational tone. ""dan"" (and) would be more appropriate.

5. ""tepat di sebelahnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""di sampingnya"" (beside it) would be more natural.

6. ""tahu?"" - While acceptable, this is a very informal way of asking ""see?"". A more natural and slightly less colloquial option would be ""kamu tahu?"" (do you know?) or simply omitting it.

7. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit awkward. ""Di sanalah perapian akan ada"" (The fireplace will be there) is more natural.

8. ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - The sentence structure is a bit awkward. It could be improved to ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can put a gas grill on the deck to grill steaks.)

The translation needs revision to improve its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""di luar jalur yang umum""**: While literally correct, this phrase is a bit clunky and formal. A more natural Indonesian equivalent would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place) or ""di lokasi yang tidak biasa"" (in an unusual location).
2.  **""pondok kayu sungguhan""**: The repetition of ""sungguhan"" (real) feels redundant. ""Pondok kayu"" is sufficient.
3.  **""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural. ""Kamar mandi yang bersebelahan"" (the adjacent bathroom) or ""kamar mandi yang berada tepat di sebelah"" (the bathroom located right next to) would be better.
4.  **""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""**: The sentence is too long and convoluted. It could be broken down into two shorter sentences for better readability. Also, ""belanjaan"" is a bit informal; ""pembelian"" (purchases) or ""barang belanjaan"" (shopping goods) would be more appropriate depending on the context.
5.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak.""**: The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" (And you can) is awkward. It should be rephrased to avoid this repetition. The phrase ""Untuk steak"" is also a bit abrupt. It could be softened to ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (To grill steak) or ""Untuk memasak steak"" (To cook steak).

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its natural flow and stylistic consistency. The translation is too literal in places, resulting in awkward phrasing. The use of ""rumah itu"" (that house) after ""Tentu saja"" (Of course) is unnecessary and disrupts the flow. The repetition of ""di sini"" (here) and ""di"" (at/in) is also noticeable. The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere untuk mobil"" is technically correct but sounds clunky. The phrase ""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" is grammatically correct but overly verbose. The use of ""tahu?"" (know?) is too informal and doesn't quite capture the casual tone of the original. The translation of ""For steaks"" as ""untuk memanggang steak"" is correct but lacks the punch of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" - ""Of course, that house must be far from the crowd.""  Better: ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang tenang."" (Of course, the house must be in a quiet place.) The ""that house"" is redundant.
2. ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" - ""I want its appearance to be like a log cabin, but without the inconvenience of a real log cabin."" Better: ""Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" (I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the inconveniences of a real log cabin.)  ""Tampilannya"" is a bit formal; ""terlihat"" (looks like) is more natural.
3. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?"" - ""There's a terrace on the right side of the kitchen, know?"" Better: ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, kan?"" (There's a terrace on the right side of the kitchen, right?) or ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur. Kamu tahu?"" (There's a terrace on the right side of the kitchen. You know?) The original uses a rhetorical question to seek confirmation, which is better reflected by ""kan?"" or ""Kamu tahu?"".
4. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras."" - ""That's where the fireplace will be, and you can store firewood on the terrace."" Better: ""Di sanalah perapian akan ada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras."" (That's where the fireplace will be, and you can store firewood on the terrace.) The use of ""berada"" is more natural than ""akan berada"".
5. ""Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" - ""You can also put a gas grill on the terrace to grill steak."" Better: ""Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" (You can also put a gas grill on the terrace to grill steak.) The phrasing is fine, but the sentence is a bit long and could be broken up.

1.  **""di luar jalur yang umum""**: While literally correct, this phrase is a bit clunky and formal. A more natural Indonesian equivalent would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place) or ""di lokasi yang tidak biasa"" (in an unusual location).
2.  **""pondok kayu sungguhan""**: The repetition of ""sungguhan"" (real) feels redundant. ""Pondok kayu"" is sufficient.
3.  **""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural. ""Kamar mandi yang bersebelahan"" (the adjacent bathroom) or ""kamar mandi yang berada tepat di sebelah"" (the bathroom located right next to) would be better.
4.  **""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""**: The sentence is too long and convoluted. It could be broken down into two shorter sentences for better readability. Also, ""belanjaan"" is a bit informal; ""pembelian"" (purchases) or ""barang belanjaan"" (shopping goods) would be more appropriate depending on the context.
5.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak.""**: The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" (And you can) is awkward. It should be rephrased to avoid this repetition. The phrase ""Untuk steak"" is also a bit abrupt. It could be softened to ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (To grill steak) or ""Untuk memasak steak"" (To cook steak).

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the core meaning of the source text. However, it suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic fidelity.

1.  **""Jauh dari keramaian""**: While accurate, ""jauh dari keramaian"" (far from the crowd) is a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di luar pusat kota"" (outside the city center), depending on the intended nuance. ""Far from the beaten road"" implies a sense of seclusion, not just distance from crowds.
2.  **""Pondok kayu""**: This is a literal translation of ""log cabin"" and doesn't quite capture the intended image. While ""pondok kayu"" is understandable, it might sound more like a simple wooden hut than a charming log cabin. Consider using ""rumah bergaya pondok kayu"" (log cabin-style house) or ""rumah kayu dengan desain pondok"" (wooden house with a cabin design).
3.  **""Ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This translation is a bit awkward. ""Ketidaknyamanan"" (inconveniences) is correct, but the phrasing is not idiomatic. A better option would be ""kekurangan pondok kayu"" (shortcomings of a log cabin) or ""masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (problems typically found in log cabins).
4.  **""Mengquis segelas bir""**: ""Mengquis"" (to search for) is not the correct verb to use here. ""Minum segelas bir"" (to drink a glass of beer) or ""memesan segelas bir"" (to order a glass of beer) would be more appropriate. ""Mengquis"" implies a search, not the act of drinking.
5.  **""Tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it"" and sounds unnatural. ""Berdekatan"" (nearby) or ""bersebelahan"" (adjacent) would be better choices.
6.  **""Kan?""**: The addition of ""kan?"" (right?) is unnecessary and makes the Indonesian sound less polished. It's a conversational tag that doesn't translate well.
7.  **""Memanggang steak""**: While understandable, ""memanggang steak"" is a bit formal. ""Memasak steak"" (cooking steak) or ""membuat steak"" (making steak) would sound more natural in this context.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its natural flow and stylistic consistency. The translation is too literal in places, resulting in awkward phrasing. The use of ""rumah itu"" (that house) after ""Tentu saja"" (Of course) is unnecessary and disrupts the flow. The repetition of ""di sini"" (here) and ""di"" (at/in) is also noticeable. The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere untuk mobil"" is technically correct but sounds clunky. The phrase ""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" is grammatically correct but overly verbose. The use of ""tahu?"" (know?) is too informal and doesn't quite capture the casual tone of the original. The translation of ""For steaks"" as ""untuk memanggang steak"" is correct but lacks the punch of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" - ""Of course, that house must be far from the crowd.""  Better: ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang tenang."" (Of course, the house must be in a quiet place.) The ""that house"" is redundant.
2. ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" - ""I want its appearance to be like a log cabin, but without the inconvenience of a real log cabin."" Better: ""Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" (I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the inconveniences of a real log cabin.)  ""Tampilannya"" is a bit formal; ""terlihat"" (looks like) is more natural.
3. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?"" - ""There's a terrace on the right side of the kitchen, know?"" Better: ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, kan?"" (There's a terrace on the right side of the kitchen, right?) or ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur. Kamu tahu?"" (There's a terrace on the right side of the kitchen. You know?) The original uses a rhetorical question to seek confirmation, which is better reflected by ""kan?"" or ""Kamu tahu?"".
4. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras."" - ""That's where the fireplace will be, and you can store firewood on the terrace."" Better: ""Di sanalah perapian akan ada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras."" (That's where the fireplace will be, and you can store firewood on the terrace.) The use of ""berada"" is more natural than ""akan berada"".
5. ""Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" - ""You can also put a gas grill on the terrace to grill steak."" Better: ""Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" (You can also put a gas grill on the terrace to grill steak.) The phrasing is fine, but the sentence is a bit long and could be broken up.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency. The translation is overly literal in places, resulting in awkward phrasing. The use of ""Tentu saja"" repeated multiple times feels unnatural and repetitive in Indonesian. The translation of ""off the beaten road"" as ""jauh dari keramaian"" is accurate but lacks the evocative quality of the original. The translation of ""porte cochere"" is correct, but the surrounding sentence structure feels clunky. The repetition of ""di sini"" (here) and ""di sanalah"" (there) makes the text sound monotonous. The phrase ""bahkan"" (even) is used unnecessarily. The overall flow is not as smooth as the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling. -> ""Ceritakan padaku tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis, sambil tersenyum. (Acceptable)
2. ""It will have to be off the beaten road..."" -> ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian.""  A better translation would be: ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang terpencil..."" or ""Tentu saja, aku ingin rumah itu jauh dari hiruk pikuk kota."" The current translation is too literal and doesn't capture the sense of seclusion.
3. ""...but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin."" -> ""...tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu."" A more natural translation would be: ""...tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya muncul pada pondok kayu.""
4. ""There'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars..."" -> ""Akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil..."" The sentence structure is awkward. A better translation would be: ""Ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa langsung turun dari mobil ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan.""
5. ""Or maybe I'd put it off the family room."" -> ""atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di sisi ruang keluarga."" This is grammatically correct but lacks flow. A better option would be: ""atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di dekat ruang keluarga.""
6. ""For steaks."" -> ""untuk memanggang steak."" This is acceptable, but could be more natural. ""Untuk memanggang steak, tentu saja.""

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of introspection as the speaker reveals details about their dream house. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language to paint a picture of the house. The meaning is clear and easy to follow, detailing the speaker's vision for their ideal home. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The inclusion of the French term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of sophistication and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't capture the intended meaning of seclusion and tranquility. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place).
2.  **""tanpa kekurangannya""**: This is a literal translation of ""without the inconveniences,"" but it sounds awkward in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""tetapi tanpa masalah-masalah yang ada pada pondok kayu biasa"" (but without the problems of a regular log cabin) or ""tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (but without the inconveniences usually found in log cabins).
3.  **""kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""kamar mandi yang bersebelahan dengan dapur"" (the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen) or ""kamar mandi yang berada tepat di samping dapur"" (the bathroom right next to the kitchen) would be more natural.
4.  **""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""**: The sentence is a bit long and convoluted. It could be broken down into two sentences for clarity. Also, ""belanjaan"" is a bit informal; ""pembelian"" (purchases) or ""barang belanjaan"" (shopping goods) would be more appropriate depending on the context.
5.  **""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?""**: The inclusion of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone of the text. It should be omitted.
6.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is grammatically correct, but ""Di sanalah perapian akan ditempatkan"" (The fireplace will be placed there) sounds more natural.
7.  **""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk steak.""**: This is a bit abrupt. Adding a phrase like ""tentu saja"" (of course) or ""sehingga"" (so that) would improve the flow. ""Untuk steak"" is also a bit redundant; it's implied that the grill is for cooking steaks.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Off the beaten road"" implies a location that is secluded and perhaps a bit remote, not just far from a crowd. A better translation would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place) or ""di lokasi yang agak tersembunyi"" (in a somewhat hidden location).

2.  **""pondok kayu""**: This is a literal translation of ""log cabin"" and is acceptable, but it lacks the charm and imagery of the original. ""Rumah kayu"" (wooden house) is a more common and natural way to say it in Indonesian, and it still conveys the intended image.

3.  **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Inconveniences of a real log cabin"" could be better rendered as ""kekurangan rumah kayu asli"" (the drawbacks of a real log cabin) or ""masalah yang sering terjadi pada rumah kayu asli"" (problems often encountered with real log cabins).

4.  **""tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal. ""Tepat di sampingnya"" is more natural.

5.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The phrase ""Di bagian belakang, ada..."" and ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur..."" are repetitive and can be improved. Consider rephrasing to avoid this repetition. For example, ""Di bagian belakang rumah, terdapat..."" or ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur.""

6.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone of the text. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence.

7.  **""Untuk steak""**: This is a literal translation and sounds awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (to grill steak) or ""Untuk memasak steak"" (to cook steak).

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but contains several areas for improvement in terms of naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and remoteness. ""jauh dari keramaian"" simply means ""far from the crowd"" and doesn't fully capture the intended meaning. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).

2. ""masalah yang sering terjadi pada pondok kayu asli"" - This is a literal translation and sounds awkward in Indonesian. It would be more natural to say ""kekurangan pondok kayu asli"" (the drawbacks of a real log cabin) or ""kesulitan yang biasanya dihadapi dengan pondok kayu asli"" (the difficulties usually faced with a real log cabin).

3. ""mengulurkan tangan untuk minum bir"" - This is a slightly unnatural way to say ""taking a sip of beer."" A more common and natural phrase would be ""minum bir"" (drinking beer) or ""mengambil tegukan bir"" (taking a sip of beer).

4. ""tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but a bit formal. ""tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" would sound more natural.

5. ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?"" - The use of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is a direct translation and feels out of place. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence. ""Teras terletak di sisi kanan dapur, bukan?"" (The terrace is located on the right side of the kitchen, isn't it?) or ""Teras ada di sisi kanan dapur"" (The terrace is on the right side of the kitchen) would be more appropriate.

6. ""menggunakan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - This is a bit clunky. ""menggunakan panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak"" (using a gas grill on the terrace to grill steak) would be smoother.

""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Off the beaten road"" implies a location that is secluded and perhaps a bit remote, not just far from a crowd. A better translation would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place) or ""di lokasi yang agak tersembunyi"" (in a somewhat hidden location).

2.  **""pondok kayu""**: This is a literal translation of ""log cabin"" and is acceptable, but it lacks the charm and imagery of the original. ""Rumah kayu"" (wooden house) is a more common and natural way to say it in Indonesian, and it still conveys the intended image.

3.  **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Inconveniences of a real log cabin"" could be better rendered as ""kekurangan rumah kayu asli"" (the drawbacks of a real log cabin) or ""masalah yang sering terjadi pada rumah kayu asli"" (problems often encountered with real log cabins).

4.  **""tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal. ""Tepat di sampingnya"" is more natural.

5.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The phrase ""Di bagian belakang, ada..."" and ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur..."" are repetitive and can be improved. Consider rephrasing to avoid this repetition. For example, ""Di bagian belakang rumah, terdapat..."" or ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur.""

6.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone of the text. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence.

7.  **""Untuk steak""**: This is a literal translation and sounds awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (to grill steak) or ""Untuk memasak steak"" (to cook steak).

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to improve its naturalness, stylistic consistency, and overall flow. Specifically, the translator should focus on using more idiomatic Indonesian expressions, avoiding overly literal translations, and varying sentence structure to create a more engaging and readable text. The repetitive use of ""di"" and the informal ""lihat?"" are noticeable flaws that should be addressed. The phrasing around the *porte cochere* and the kitchen/washroom location could be more elegant.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its natural flow and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and perhaps a slightly adventurous location. ""jauh dari keramaian"" simply means ""far from the crowd"" and lacks that nuance. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang agak tersembunyi"" (in a somewhat hidden location).

2. ""masalah yang sering terjadi pada pondok kayu asli"" - This is a literal translation of ""inconveniences of a real log cabin"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Inconveniences"" refers to the practical difficulties of living in a log cabin (e.g., maintenance, insulation). A more natural translation would be ""kesulitan yang sering dihadapi dalam pondok kayu asli"" (difficulties often faced in a real log cabin) or ""kekurangan pondok kayu asli"" (shortcomings of a real log cabin).

3. ""mengquis bir"" - This is a slightly awkward translation of ""taking a sip of beer."" ""Mengquis"" implies searching or grasping, which doesn't fit the context. A better option would be ""meminum bir"" (drinking beer) or ""meneguk bir"" (sipping beer).

4. ""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal. ""Di sampingnya"" is a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""dengan kamar mandi di sebelahnya"" (with the bathroom next to it) or ""dengan kamar mandi yang berdekatan"" (with the bathroom that is close by).

5. ""tahu?"" - While acceptable in informal conversation, it feels out of place in the overall tone of the translation. It's a direct transliteration of ""you know?"" and doesn't add much value. It can be omitted.

6. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit clunky. ""Di sanalah"" is redundant. A better phrasing would be ""Di sana perapian akan berada"" (There, the fireplace will be) or simply ""Perapian akan berada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there).

7. The repetition of ""di"" before several nouns (e.g., ""di belakang rumah,"" ""di sisi kanan dapur"") becomes monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow.

""jauh dari keramaian"" simply means ""far from the crowd"" and doesn't fully capture the intended meaning. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).

2. ""masalah yang sering terjadi pada pondok kayu asli"" - This is a literal translation and sounds awkward in Indonesian.

""Teras terletak di sisi kanan dapur, bukan?""

The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the natural flow and style of Indonesian.

2. ""kesulitan yang sering dihadapi dalam pondok kayu asli"" - This is a bit clunky. A better translation would be ""masalah yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu asli"" (problems usually found in a real log cabin) or ""kekurangan pondok kayu asli"" (disadvantages of a real log cabin).
3. ""di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""tepat di sebelah"" (right next to) or ""berdekatan dengan"" (close to) would be more natural.
4. ""Di sisi kanan dapur, ada teras, tahu?"" - The inclusion of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is a direct translation of the informal English and doesn't quite fit the Indonesian conversational style. It can be omitted or replaced with a more natural phrase like ""Di sisi kanan dapur, ada teras.""
5. ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" - This is a bit repetitive. It could be simplified to ""Akan ada perapian di sana.""
6. ""Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - The use of ""Kamu"" (you) is slightly odd. It's better to use a more general phrasing like ""Anda"" (you - formal) or omit the pronoun altogether. ""Anda juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" or ""Anda juga bisa menggunakan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" would be better.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of introspection as the speaker reveals details about their dream house. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language to convey the speaker's vision. The meaning is clear and easy to follow, detailing the features of the dream house. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The speaker's slightly hesitant delivery (""slowly,"" ""I didn't talk about too often"") contributes to the natural feel of the dialogue.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that affect its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't capture the intended meaning of being secluded or in a rural location. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di luar jalur utama"" (off the main path).
2.  **""masalah yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu asli""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Inconveniences"" is better rendered as ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings, disadvantages) or ""kesulitan"" (difficulties). The phrase is grammatically correct but lacks elegance.
3.  **""di sebelahnya""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it"" and sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""tepat di sampingnya"" or ""berdekatan dengan.""
4.  **""Di bagian belakang""**: This is a bit redundant. ""Di bagian belakang rumah"" (at the back of the house) would be more natural.
5.  **""*porte cochere* untuk mobil""**: While the term *porte cochere* can be understood, it's not commonly used in Indonesian. It would be better to use a descriptive phrase like ""tempat parkir tertutup"" (covered parking space) or ""area parkir yang terlindung"" (sheltered parking area) to convey the meaning.
6.  **""tahu?""**: The use of ""tahu?"" at the end of the sentence is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone of the conversation. It's a colloquialism that should be avoided in formal writing.
7.  **Repetitive sentence structure**: The translation relies heavily on short, declarative sentences, which makes it sound choppy. Combining some sentences would improve the flow.

The translation needs significant revision to improve its naturalness and stylistic consistency. The use of more idiomatic expressions and descriptive language is crucial to capture the nuances of the original text.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and conversational.

The meaning is clear and easy to understand, focusing on the speaker's preferences and desires for their ideal home.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the natural flow and style of Indonesian.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, this is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" sounds slightly unnatural in this context.
2. ""kesulitan yang sering dihadapi dalam pondok kayu asli"" - This is a bit clunky. A better translation would be ""masalah yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu asli"" (problems usually found in a real log cabin) or ""kekurangan pondok kayu asli"" (disadvantages of a real log cabin).
3. ""di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""tepat di sebelah"" (right next to) or ""berdekatan dengan"" (close to) would be more natural.
4. ""Di sisi kanan dapur, ada teras, tahu?"" - The inclusion of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is a direct translation of the informal English and doesn't quite fit the Indonesian conversational style. It can be omitted or replaced with a more natural phrase like ""Di sisi kanan dapur, ada teras.""
5. ""Di sana akan ada perapian"" - This is a bit repetitive. It could be simplified to ""Akan ada perapian di sana.""
6. ""Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - The use of ""Kamu"" (you) is slightly odd. It's better to use a more general phrasing like ""Anda"" (you - formal) or omit the pronoun altogether. ""Anda juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" or ""Anda juga bisa menggunakan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak."" would be better.

4. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" - The sentence is a bit long and convoluted. It could be broken down into two sentences for clarity. Also, ""belanjaan"" is a bit formal; ""pembelian"" (purchases) or ""barang belanjaan"" (shopping goods) might be better depending on the context.
5. ""lihat?"" - This is an informal interjection. While it's acceptable, it could be replaced with a more natural Indonesian equivalent like ""kan?"" (right?) or simply omitted.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of phrases like ""of course"" and the slightly hesitant delivery (""slowly"") contribute to the natural, conversational feel. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the core meaning of the source text. However, it suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency. The translation is overly literal in places, resulting in awkward phrasing and a less engaging read.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - ""off the beaten road."" While understandable, this is a rather clunky translation. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).
2. ""kerepotan pondok kayu sungguhan"" - ""inconveniences of a real log cabin."" This is a very literal translation and doesn't flow well in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""kesulitan yang biasanya dihadapi dengan pondok kayu"" (the difficulties usually encountered with a log cabin) or ""masalah-masalah yang sering muncul pada pondok kayu"" (problems that often arise with log cabins).
3. ""mengquis segelas bir"" - ""taking a sip of beer."" ""Mengquis"" implies a more forceful or greedy action than simply taking a sip. ""Minum segelas bir"" (drinking a glass of beer) would be more appropriate.
4. ""bersebelahan langsung dengannya"" - ""right off of it."" This is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less natural than a more colloquial expression. ""tepat di sampingnya"" (directly beside it) or ""berdekatan dengan dapur"" (close to the kitchen) would be better.
5. ""kan?"" - ""see?"" This is a very direct translation of an interjection and doesn't quite capture the conversational tone. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence to convey the same meaning without the tag question.
6. ""memasang panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" - ""And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks."" This is a bit repetitive and lacks elegance. A more concise and natural phrasing would be ""Dan ada panggangan gas di teras, untuk memanggang steak."" (And there's a gas grill on the deck, for grilling steaks.)

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language. The meaning is clear and easy to understand. The narrator is describing their ideal home, focusing on practical details and personal preferences. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""without the inconveniences"" adds a touch of personality. The repetition of ""of course"" emphasizes the narrator's certainty and preferences.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the natural flow and style of Indonesian.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, this is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" sounds a little stiff in this context.
2. ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" - The phrase ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" is a bit redundant. ""Pondok kayu asli"" (original log cabin) or ""pondok kayu yang sesungguhnya"" (the real log cabin) would be more natural.
3. ""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit awkward. ""Kamar mandi yang bersebelahan dengan dapur"" (the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen) or ""kamar mandi yang berada tepat di sebelah dapur"" (the bathroom right next to the kitchen) would be smoother.
4. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" - The sentence is a bit long and convoluted. It could be broken down into two sentences for clarity. Also, ""belanjaan"" is a bit formal; ""pembelian"" (purchases) or ""barang belanjaan"" (shopping goods) might be better depending on the context.
5. ""lihat?"" - This is an informal interjection. While it's acceptable, it could be replaced with a more natural Indonesian equivalent like ""kan?"" (right?) or simply omitted.
6. ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - The phrasing is a bit clunky. ""Dan kamu bisa memasang panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can install a gas grill on the deck. To grill steaks.) would sound more natural.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that affect its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and remoteness that ""jauh dari keramaian"" doesn't fully capture. It could be improved to something like ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).
2. ""kesulitan yang biasanya dihadapi dengan pondok kayu"" - This is a very literal translation and sounds awkward in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""masalah yang sering muncul pada pondok kayu"" (problems often encountered with log cabins) or ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu"" (the inconveniences of log cabins).
3. ""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""tepat di sampingnya"" is a bit formal. A better option would be ""berdekatan dengan dapur"" (adjacent to the kitchen) or ""di dekat dapur"" (near the kitchen).
4. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" - The sentence is a bit long and convoluted. It could be broken down into two sentences for clarity. Also, ""belanjaan"" is a bit informal; ""pembelian"" (purchases) might be more appropriate depending on the context.
5. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?"" - The addition of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone of the text. It should be removed.
6. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras, untuk memanggang steak."" - The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" is clunky. It can be rephrased to improve flow.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of phrases like ""of course"" and the slightly hesitant delivery (""slowly"") contribute to the natural, conversational feel. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the core meaning of the source text. However, it suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency. The translation is overly literal in places, resulting in awkward phrasing and a less engaging read.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - ""off the beaten road."" While understandable, this is a rather clunky translation. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).
2. ""kerepotan pondok kayu sungguhan"" - ""inconveniences of a real log cabin."" This is a very literal translation and doesn't flow well in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""kesulitan yang biasanya dihadapi dengan pondok kayu"" (the difficulties usually encountered with a log cabin) or ""masalah-masalah yang sering muncul pada pondok kayu"" (problems that often arise with log cabins).
3. ""mengquis segelas bir"" - ""taking a sip of beer."" ""Mengquis"" implies a more forceful or greedy action than simply taking a sip. ""Minum segelas bir"" (drinking a glass of beer) would be more appropriate.
4. ""bersebelahan langsung dengannya"" - ""right off of it."" This is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less natural than a more colloquial expression. ""tepat di sampingnya"" (directly beside it) or ""berdekatan dengan dapur"" (close to the kitchen) would be better.
5. ""kan?"" - ""see?"" This is a very direct translation of an interjection and doesn't quite capture the conversational tone. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence to convey the same meaning without the tag question.
6. ""memasang panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" - ""And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks."" This is a bit repetitive and lacks elegance. A more concise and natural phrasing would be ""Dan ada panggangan gas di teras, untuk memanggang steak."" (And there's a gas grill on the deck, for grilling steaks.)

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs significant revision to improve its naturalness and stylistic flow. The current translation is too literal and lacks the conversational tone of the original. Focus on using more idiomatic Indonesian expressions and avoiding overly literal translations. Pay attention to sentence structure and phrasing to create a more engaging and natural reading experience. Specifically, address the issues mentioned above regarding word choice and phrasing to better reflect the original text's tone and style.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't capture the intended meaning of seclusion and tranquility. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place).
2.  **""ketidaknyamanan yang biasa ada di pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Inconveniences"" could be better conveyed as ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings) or ""kesulitan"" (difficulties). The phrase is grammatically correct but lacks elegance.
3.  **""di sana, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is a very literal translation and sounds unnatural. ""tepat di sebelahnya"" is redundant.

4.  **""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah""**: The use of ""supaya kamu bisa"" is overly formal and sounds unnatural in this context. A more natural phrasing would be ""agar kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" or even ""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan"" (so you can bring groceries directly to the kitchen without getting wet).
5.  **""misalnya""**: The use of ""misalnya"" (for example) is appropriate, but it could be integrated more smoothly.
6.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is a bit stiff. ""Di sanalah"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Di sana perapiannya"" (There's a fireplace there) or ""Perapiannya akan berada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there).

The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and informal, using colloquial language (""Tell me about..."", ""Okay,"" ""Of course""). The style is descriptive and conversational, with the speaker detailing their dream house in a natural, flowing manner. The meaning is straightforward: the speaker is describing their vision for a house, highlighting specific features and their practical benefits. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural progression of thought and agreement.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally good, but it contains several areas that need improvement to better capture the nuances of the original text.

1. ""Ceritakan dong tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum. - This is a good translation of ""Tell me about your dream house,"" capturing the informal tone.

2. ""Oke,"" ujarku, pelan-pelan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. - ""Pelan-pelan"" is a bit awkward here. ""Slowly"" is better conveyed by ""dengan ragu-ragu"" (hesitantly) or ""dengan hati-hati"" (carefully), depending on the intended nuance. ""Jarang sekali"" is fine, but could be more natural as ""tidak sering"" (not often).

3. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" - This is a good translation.

4. ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" - This is a good translation, but ""semua ketidaknyamanan"" is a bit verbose. ""Ketidaknyamanan"" alone is sufficient.

5. ""Aku menemukan gambarnya di internet dan membelinya."" - This is a good translation.

6. ""Tentu,"" katanya sambil mengicipi bir. - This is a good translation.

7. ""Rumahnya akan terdiri dari dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, plus ruang keluarga."" - ""Plus"" is a bit awkward in Indonesian. ""Dan"" (and) is more natural.

8. ""Akan ada dapur di sana, dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan."" - This is a good translation.

9. ""Aku menunduk, menggambar di meja dengan jariku."" - This is a good translation.

10. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" - This is a good translation, but the phrasing is a bit clunky. ""Tanpa terkena hujan"" is a bit literal. A more natural phrasing would be ""tanpa perlu keluar di bawah hujan"" (without needing to go out in the rain).

11. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di dekat ruang keluarga."" - ""Tahu?"" is a bit informal and doesn't quite capture the casual tone. It could be replaced with ""bisa jadi"" (maybe) or simply omitted.

12. ""Di sanalah perapiannya akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras."" - This is a good translation.

13. ""Kamu juga bisa menggunakan teras untuk memanggang steak."" - This is a good translation.

The translation needs revision to improve the flow and naturalness of the Indonesian. Specifically:

*   **Paragraph 2:** Replace ""pelan-pelan"" with ""dengan ragu-ragu"" or ""dengan hati-hati"" to better convey the speaker's hesitation. Replace ""jarang sekali aku bicarakan"" with ""tidak sering aku bicarakan.""
*   **Paragraph 4:** Shorten ""semua ketidaknyamanan"" to ""ketidaknyamanan.""
*   **Paragraph 6:** Replace ""plus"" with ""dan.""
*   **Paragraph 10:** Rephrase ""tanpa terkena hujan"" to ""tanpa perlu keluar di bawah hujan.""
*   **Paragraph 11:** Consider removing ""tahu?"" or replacing it with ""bisa jadi.""",Tue Oct 21 02:35:53 2025,"Your primary directive is to provide a fluent, accurate, and contextually appropriate translation from English to Indonesian.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of introspection as the speaker reveals details about their dream house. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language to paint a picture of the house. The meaning is clear and easy to follow, detailing the speaker's vision for their ideal home. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The speaker's slightly hesitant delivery (""slowly"") adds to the natural feel of the dialogue.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't capture the intended meaning of seclusion and tranquility. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place).
2.  **""ketidaknyamanan yang biasa ada di pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Inconveniences"" could be better conveyed as ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings) or ""kesulitan"" (difficulties). The phrase is grammatically correct but lacks elegance.
3.  **""di sana, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is a very literal translation and sounds unnatural. ""tepat di sebelahnya"" is redundant. A more natural phrasing would be ""di sana, dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan"" (there, with the bathroom adjacent to it) or ""di sana, kamar mandi berada tepat di sampingnya"" (there, the bathroom is right next to it).
4.  **""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah""**: The use of ""supaya kamu bisa"" is overly formal and sounds unnatural in this context. A more natural phrasing would be ""agar kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" or even ""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan"" (so you can bring groceries directly to the kitchen without getting wet).
5.  **""misalnya""**: The use of ""misalnya"" (for example) is appropriate, but it could be integrated more smoothly.
6.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is a bit stiff. ""Di sanalah"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Di sana perapiannya"" (There's a fireplace there) or ""Perapiannya akan berada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there).
7.  **""Kamu juga bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak""**: The use of ""Kamu juga bisa"" is a bit repetitive and sounds unnatural. It could be rephrased as ""Kamu juga bisa menggunakan teras untuk memanggang steak"" (You can also use the deck to grill steaks) or ""Dan kamu bisa memanggang steak di teras."" (And you can grill steaks on the deck).

The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the tone, style, and nuance of the English.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and remoteness, not just distance from crowds. A better translation might be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang sepi"" (in a quiet place).
2. ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" - The addition of ""yang sebenarnya"" (the real one) is redundant and sounds unnatural in Indonesian. It's better to simply say ""pondok kayu"" (log cabin).
3. ""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""kamar mandi yang bersebelahan dengan dapur"" (the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen) or ""kamar mandi yang berada di dekat dapur"" (the bathroom near the kitchen).
4. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit awkward. A smoother translation would be ""Di sanalah perapian akan dipasang"" (That's where the fireplace will be installed) or ""Perapian akan berada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there).
5. The repetition of ""di teras"" (on the deck) is a little monotonous. Consider using synonyms or rephrasing to avoid this repetition. For example, ""Kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras itu"" (You can put the gas grill on that deck).

The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the tone, style, and nuance of the source text.

1. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama."" - While accurate, ""jauh dari jalan utama"" is a bit literal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang terpencil."" (Of course, the house must be in a secluded place.) This maintains the meaning while sounding more idiomatic.

2. ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa kesulitan yang biasa ada di pondok kayu sungguhan."" - The phrase ""kesulitan yang biasa ada di pondok kayu sungguhan"" is a bit clunky. A better translation would be ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kerumitan pondok kayu biasa."" (I want it to look like a log cabin, but without all the complexities of a regular log cabin.) This is more concise and flows better.

3. ""Akan ada dapur di sana, dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan langsung dengan dapur."" - ""Bersebelahan langsung"" is grammatically correct but sounds formal. ""Dengan kamar mandi yang tepat di samping dapur"" (with the bathroom right next to the kitchen) is more natural.

4. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?"" - The addition of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is a direct translation of the informal tag question and is acceptable, but it can be omitted for a smoother flow. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur"" is perfectly understandable.

5. ""*Porte cochere*"" is correctly translated as ""*porte cochere*"". While it's acceptable to leave it in the original language, it would be beneficial to include a brief explanation or definition the first time it's used, or to provide a more common Indonesian equivalent if one exists.

The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The inclusion of the term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of sophistication or attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the tone, style, and nuance of the English.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and remoteness, not just distance from crowds. A better translation might be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang sepi"" (in a quiet place).
2. ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" - The addition of ""yang sebenarnya"" (the real one) is redundant and sounds unnatural in Indonesian. It's better to simply say ""pondok kayu"" (log cabin).
3. ""kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be ""kamar mandi yang bersebelahan dengan dapur"" (the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen) or ""kamar mandi yang berada di dekat dapur"" (the bathroom near the kitchen).
4. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit awkward. A smoother translation would be ""Di sanalah perapian akan dipasang"" (That's where the fireplace will be installed) or ""Perapian akan berada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there).
5. The repetition of ""di teras"" (on the deck) is a little monotonous. Consider using synonyms or rephrasing to avoid this repetition. For example, ""Kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras itu"" (You can put the gas grill on that deck).

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, focusing on details of the house's features. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its amenities. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the core meaning of the source text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the natural flow and nuance of the English.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and remoteness, not just distance from crowds. A better translation might be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang sepi"" (in a quiet place).
2. ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" - The phrase ""real log cabin"" is a bit redundant in English. The Indonesian translation repeats this redundancy. It should be simplified to ""pondok kayu asli"" (authentic log cabin) or ""pondok kayu sungguhan"" (genuine log cabin).
3. ""di sebelahnya"" - This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it."" It sounds slightly awkward in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""tepat di sampingnya"" or ""berdekatan dengan.""
4. ""tahu?"" - The use of ""tahu?"" is a direct translation of ""see?"" and while understandable, it feels a bit forced and unnatural in this context. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence. For example, ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur.""
5. ""Untuk steak."" - This is a very literal translation of ""For steaks."" It's grammatically correct but lacks the casual, slightly playful tone of the original. A more natural translation would be ""Untuk memanggang steak."" or ""Agar bisa memanggang steak.""

The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of introspection as the speaker describes their dream house. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language to convey details about the house's features. The meaning is clear and easy to understand, focusing on the speaker's preferences and desires for their ideal home. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The inclusion of the French term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of sophistication and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the tone, style, and nuance of the source text.

1. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama."" - While accurate, ""jauh dari jalan utama"" is a bit literal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang terpencil."" (Of course, the house must be in a secluded place.) This maintains the meaning while sounding more idiomatic.

2. ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa kesulitan yang biasa ada di pondok kayu sungguhan."" - The phrase ""kesulitan yang biasa ada di pondok kayu sungguhan"" is a bit clunky. A better translation would be ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kerumitan pondok kayu biasa."" (I want it to look like a log cabin, but without all the complexities of a regular log cabin.) This is more concise and flows better.

3. ""Akan ada dapur di sana, dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan langsung dengan dapur."" - ""Bersebelahan langsung"" is grammatically correct but sounds formal. ""Dengan kamar mandi yang tepat di samping dapur"" (with the bathroom right next to the kitchen) is more natural.

4. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?"" - The addition of ""tahu?"" (you know?) is a direct translation of the informal tag question and is acceptable, but it can be omitted for a smoother flow. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur"" is perfectly understandable.

5. ""*Porte cochere*"" is correctly translated as ""*porte cochere*"". While it's acceptable to leave it in the original language, it would be beneficial to include a brief explanation or definition the first time it's used, or to provide a more common Indonesian equivalent if one exists. Otherwise, it might be confusing for some readers.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of wistfulness and detail. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using everyday language. The meaning is clear and easy to follow, detailing the narrator's vision for their ideal home. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and the specific details about the house (porte cochere, gas grill for steaks) contribute to a sense of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari hiruk pikuk"" - While ""far from the hustle and bustle"" is a correct translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it lacks the nuance of seclusion and tranquility implied in the original. ""Off the beaten road"" suggests a degree of isolation and a desire for peace, which is not fully captured here. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place).

2. ""kesulitan hidup seperti pondok kayu sungguhan"" - This is a literal translation of ""inconveniences of a real log cabin"" and doesn't flow well in Indonesian. It's grammatically correct but sounds awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" (the inconveniences of a real log cabin) or ""masalah-masalah yang biasanya dihadapi di pondok kayu"" (the problems usually faced in a log cabin).

3. ""mengquis segelas bir"" - ""Mengquis"" means to search for or hunt for something. It's not the right word to describe taking a sip of beer. A better translation would be ""minum segelas bir"" (drink a glass of beer) or ""meminum segelas bir"" (to drink a glass of beer).

4. ""lho"" - The addition of ""lho"" at the end of ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lho"" is unnecessary and sounds overly casual. It doesn't add any meaning and disrupts the flow of the sentence. It's a filler word that should be omitted.

5. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit redundant. ""Di sanalah"" (that's where) is unnecessary. A simpler phrasing would be ""Di sana perapian akan berada"" (There, the fireplace will be).

6. ""memasang panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" - The phrasing is a bit clunky. ""Memasang"" (to install) is not the most natural way to say ""put it"" in this context. A better option would be ""menempatkan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" (to place a gas grill on the terrace. For grilling steaks.)

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that affect its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""Baiklah ujarku, pelan-pelan."" - This is a literal translation of ""Okay, I said, slowly."" It's grammatically correct but sounds awkward and unnatural in Indonesian. ""Baiklah"" is fine, but ""ujarku, pelan-pelan"" is clunky. A better option would be ""Baiklah, aku berkata pelan-pelan"" or even just ""Baiklah, dengan hati-hati.""

2. ""Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan."" - This translates to ""This is something that I rarely talk about."" While accurate, it's a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Ini bukan sesuatu yang sering aku ceritakan"" or ""Aku jarang sekali membicarakan ini.""

3. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" - This is a direct translation of ""Of course, it will have to be off the beaten road."" While understandable, it lacks the subtle implication of the narrator's expectation. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang tenang"" or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari hiruk pikuk kota"" would be more natural.

4. ""Aku menemukan gambarnya di internet, dan membelinya."" - This is a literal translation of ""I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it."" It's grammatically correct, but the phrasing is a bit stiff. ""Aku menemukan gambarnya di internet dan membelinya"" is acceptable, but ""Aku menemukan rencana rumahnya di internet dan membelinya"" is more natural.

5. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" - The use of ""lho"" is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound overly casual. It's better to omit it. Also, ""belanjaan"" is a bit generic. ""Belanja"" is more appropriate here. The sentence could be improved to: ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanja langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""

6. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lho. Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di sisi ruang keluarga."" - Again, ""lho"" is unnecessary and detracts from the natural flow. The sentence could be improved to: ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur. Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di sisi ruang keluarga.""

7. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" - The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" is awkward. It should be rephrased to avoid this repetition. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Kamu juga bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.""

needs_revision
The translation needs revision to improve its naturalness and stylistic flow. The overuse of phrases like ""ujarku, pelan-pelan"" and ""lho"" makes the translation sound unnatural.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of wistfulness and detail. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using everyday language. The meaning is clear and easy to follow, detailing the narrator's vision for their ideal home. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and the specific details about the house (porte cochere, gas grill for steaks) contribute to a sense of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari hiruk pikuk"" - While ""far from the hustle and bustle"" is a correct translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it lacks the nuance of seclusion and tranquility implied in the original. ""Off the beaten road"" suggests a degree of isolation and a desire for peace, which is not fully captured here. A better option would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place).

2. ""kesulitan hidup seperti pondok kayu sungguhan"" - This is a literal translation of ""inconveniences of a real log cabin"" and doesn't flow well in Indonesian. It's grammatically correct but sounds awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" (the inconveniences of a real log cabin) or ""masalah-masalah yang biasanya dihadapi di pondok kayu"" (the problems usually faced in a log cabin).

3. ""mengquis segelas bir"" - ""Mengquis"" means to search for or hunt for something. It's not the right word to describe taking a sip of beer. A better translation would be ""minum segelas bir"" (drink a glass of beer) or ""meminum segelas bir"" (to drink a glass of beer).

4. ""lho"" - The addition of ""lho"" at the end of ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lho"" is unnecessary and sounds overly casual. It doesn't add any meaning and disrupts the flow of the sentence. It's a filler word that should be omitted.

5. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit redundant. ""Di sanalah"" (that's where) is unnecessary. A simpler phrasing would be ""Di sana perapian akan berada"" (There, the fireplace will be).

6. ""memasang panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" - The phrasing is a bit clunky. ""Memasang"" (to install) is not the most natural way to say ""put it"" in this context. A better option would be ""menempatkan panggangan gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" (to place a gas grill on the terrace. For grilling steaks.)
