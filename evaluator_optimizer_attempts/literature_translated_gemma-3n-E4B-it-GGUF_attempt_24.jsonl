The current phrasing is grammatically correct but lacks a certain punchiness.\n*   \"Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?\" -> \"Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\"\n    *   This is generally accurate but a little clunky. \"Makamnya terlebih dahulu\" is a bit formal. \"Makam Dell Teague terlebih dahulu\" (Dell Teague's grave first) would be clearer. \"Mencari Teenie\" is fine, but could be slightly more natural as \"menemukan Teenie\" (to find Teenie).\n*   \"Of course this boy hadn't shot himself.\" -> \"Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri.\"\n    *   This is a straightforward and accurate translation.\n*   \"Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend.\" -> \"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti kekasihnya yang liar.\"\n    *   Accurate and natural.\n*   \"I opened my eyes.\" -> \"Saya membuka mata.\"\n    *   Perfectly fine.\n*   \"Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing.\" -> \"Hollis Boxleitner berputar untuk melihat apa yang sedang saya lakukan.\"\n    *   \"Berputar\" is a good choice for \"swung around.\" \"Apa yang sedang saya lakukan\" is correct, but a little verbose. \"Apa yang saya lakukan\" would be more concise and natural.\n*   \"I looked into the intent face of the deputy.\" -> \"Saya menatap wajah serius petugas kepolisian itu.\"\n    *   \"Intent\" is a tricky word. \"Serius\" (serious) captures the feeling of intentness well in this context. \"Petugas kepolisian itu\" is a standard and accurate way to say \"the deputy.\"\n*   \"No suicide here,\" I said. -> \"Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" ujarku.\n    *   Perfectly fine. \"Ujarku\" is a standard way to indicate that you are saying something.\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, it lacks some of the stylistic punchiness and natural flow of a truly excellent translation. There are several opportunities to make the language more idiomatic and engaging. The overall tone is preserved, but some phrases feel slightly stiff. The choice of \"omong kosong\" is a good start, but the rest of the sentences could benefit from some refinement.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

The tone is sarcastic and direct. The phrase \"wild girlfriend\" implies a somewhat scandalous or unconventional relationship. The context establishes Harper's unique ability and her pragmatic, somewhat jaded, approach to her work. The reference to Dell Teague being murdered links him to Teenie's death, suggesting a potential pattern or connection.\n\nThe translation generally captures the meaning but struggles with conveying the same level of informality and directness. \"Bunuh diri, omong kosong\" is a reasonable translation of \"Suicide, my ass,\" but it lacks the punch of the original. \"Omong kosong\" is a bit too formal and doesn't quite capture the dismissive tone.  \"Waktu\" is translated as \"waktu,\" which is grammatically correct, but lacks the nuance of \"wild.\" \"Pacar buruk rontanya\" is a literal translation of \"wild girlfriend,\" and while understandable, it sounds a bit clunky and unnatural in Indonesian.\n\n**Clause-by-Clause/Phrase-by-Phrase Evaluation:**\n\n*   \"*Suicide, my ass*\" -> \"*Bunuh diri, omong kosong*\" - Acceptable, but could be stronger. Alternatives: \"*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*\" (Suicide? Don't be stupid.) or \"*Bisa-bisa bunuh diri?*\" (Could it be suicide? - implying disbelief).\n*   \"was my instant, and silent, reaction\" -> \"itu adalah reaksi instan, dan tanpa suara, saya.\" - Grammatically correct, but a bit wordy. Could be more concise: \"Reaksi instan saya adalah: *bunuh diri?*\" (My instant reaction was: suicide?).\n*   \"Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?\" -> \"Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk membaca makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\" - Grammatically correct, but the phrasing is a bit stiff. \"Makamnya\" (his grave) is correct, but could be more natural as \"makam Dell Teague\" (Dell Teague's grave). Also, \"alih-alih\" is a bit formal; \"daripada\" would be more common.\n*   \"Of course this boy hadn't shot himself.\" -> \"Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri.\" - Correct and clear.\n*   \"Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend.\" -> \"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar buruk rontanya.\" - \"Dibunuh\" is appropriate for \"murdered.\" \"Pacar buruk rontanya\" is awkward. Alternatives: \"sama seperti Teenie\" (just like Teenie - assuming the audience understands the connection) or \"sama seperti pacarnya yang bermasalah\" (just like his problematic girlfriend).\n*   \"I opened my eyes.\" -> \"Saya membuka mata.\" - Perfectly fine.\n*   \"Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing.\" -> \"Hollis Boxleitner berputar untuk melihat apa yang sedang saya lakukan.\" - \"Berputar\" is a decent translation of \"swung around,\" but it lacks the casualness of the original. Alternatives: \"Hollis Boxleitner menghampiri untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan.\" (Hollis Boxleitner approached to see what I was doing.)\n*   \"I looked into the intent face of the deputy.\" -> \"Saya menatap wajah serius wakil sheriff itu.\" - \"Serius\" is a good translation of \"intent\" in this context. \"Wakil sheriff\" is the standard translation for \"deputy.\"\n*   \"\"No suicide here,\" I said.\" -> \"\"Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" kataku.\" - Correct and natural.\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is understandable, but it lacks the sharpness and informality of the original.

While not a perfect literal translation, \"kesadaran\" (consciousness, awareness) isn't quite right either. \"Kesadaran diri\" (self-awareness) is also not a good fit. \"Kesadaran\" in this context would be more akin to \"nervous system\" or \"vulnerable point\". A better option might be \"Aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kepekaan/hal sensitifku.\"\n*   **\"Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful.\"**\n    *   *Translation:* \"Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil.\"\n    *   *Analysis:*  The translation is accurate and straightforward. \"Kurang berhasil\" is a clear and natural way to say \"less successful.\"\n*   **\"He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.\"**\n    *   *Translation:* \"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kami.\"\n    *   *Analysis:* This is a good translation. \"Mencemarkan nama baik\" accurately conveys \"impugn our honor.\" \"Sangat kesal\" is a good equivalent for \"very upset.\"\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is generally understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, the idiom \"touch my quick\" is handled awkwardly. The translation lacks a certain nuance and feels somewhat literal in that instance. The overall flow is decent, but the slightly stilted phrasing in the \"quick\" clause impacts the naturalness.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   For \"touch my quick,\" consider alternatives like:\n    *   \"Aku tidak membiarkan mereka mengusik/menyinggung kelemahanku.\" (I don't let them prick my weakness.)\n    *   \"Aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh titik lemahku.\" (I don't let them touch my weak spot.)\n    *   \"Aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyerang kebanggaanku/hormat diriku.\" (I don't let them attack my pride/self-respect.)\n\nThe repetition of \"aku\" (I) in the first three sentences could be made more elegant with some restructuring, but it's not a critical error.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

A better phrasing would be: \"dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya.\" (and I'm sure Tolliver even hates it more.) or \"dan saya yakin Tolliver sangat tidak menyukainya.\" (and I'm sure Tolliver really doesn't like it.)\n\n*   **\"I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick.\"**: \"Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan saya tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya.\" - \"Menyentuh saraf saya\" (touch my nerves) is a literal translation and doesn't quite convey the intended meaning of \"my quick.\" \"Quick\" in this context refers to a person's temper or sensitivity. Alternatives: \"Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan saya tidak membiarkan mereka memprovokasi saya.\" (I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them provoke me.) or \"Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan saya tidak membiarkan mereka mengusik saya.\" (I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them bother me.)\n\n*   **\"Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful.\"**: \"Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil.\" - This is a solid translation. \"Kurang berhasil\" (less successful) is accurate.\n\n*   **\"He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.\"**: \"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencurigai kehormatan kami.\" - \"Mencurigai kehormatan kami\" (suspect our honor) is a slightly awkward phrasing. \"Impugn\" means to attack the reputation of someone. Alternatives: \"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kami.\" (He gets very upset when people attack our reputation.) or \"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang meragukan integritas kami.\" (He gets very upset when people doubt our integrity.)\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n\n*   The translation leans too heavily on literal translations, resulting in sentences that sound unnatural in Indonesian.\n*   The tone is not consistently maintained. The original has a certain world-weariness that is not fully captured.\n*   The use of \"penipu ulung\" is too formal and doesn't fit the character's personality.\n*   The phrase \"saraf saya\" is not the most idiomatic way to express sensitivity or temper.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",

Aku ingin tampilannya seperti kabin kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu sungguhan. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.\" is generally good. However, \"jauh dari jalan utama\" is a bit literal. A more natural phrasing might be \"di lokasi yang terpencil\" (in a secluded location) or \"di tempat yang tidak ramai\" (in a quiet place). \"Ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu sungguhan\" is a bit clunky. \"Kerumitan kabin kayu sungguhan\" (the complexities of a real log cabin) would flow better. \"Mengubahnya sedikit\" is fine, but perhaps \"memodifikasinya sedikit\" (to modify it slightly) would be more precise.\n*   **\"Of course,\" he said, taking a sip of beer.** The translation \"Tentu saja, katanya sambil mengicipi bir\" is accurate and natural.\n\n**Phrase-by-Phrase Analysis:**\n\n*   \"Off the beaten road\" - \"jauh dari jalan utama\" - Acceptable, but could be improved to convey a sense of seclusion.\n*   \"Without the inconveniences\" - \"tanpa ketidaknyamanan\" - Correct, but \"kerumitan\" might be a stronger choice.\n*   \"To alter it a little\" - \"mengubahnya sedikit\" - Acceptable, but \"memodifikasinya sedikit\" is more precise.\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is coherent and understandable. The overall flow is good, although some phrases could be smoother and more idiomatic. The use of \"Tentu saja\" is appropriate for conveying the tone of the original text. The choice of \"ujarku\" for \"I said\" is a good stylistic choice. There are minor awkwardnesses in some phrasing, but nothing that significantly detracts from the overall quality.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\npass",

Aku ingin bentuknya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.\" This section is mostly accurate. \"Off the beaten road\" is well translated as \"di tempat yang terpencil.\" \"Inconveniences\" is accurately rendered as \"ketidaknyamanan.\"  \"Alter it a little\" is well translated as \"mengubahnya sedikit.\"\n*   **\"Of course,\" he said, taking a sip of beer.** - \"Tentu,\" katanya, menyesap bir.  This is a perfect translation.\n\n**Overall Coherence:**\n\nThe translation is generally coherent and understandable. The language used is appropriate for the context. However, the Indonesian feels slightly formal in places. For example, \"Tentu saja\" is used repeatedly, and while grammatically correct, it can sound a little repetitive. A more natural flow might involve varying the phrasing. The use of \"ku\" is appropriate and adds a touch of casualness, fitting the narrator's voice. The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without any significant errors.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n*   Vary the phrasing of \"Tentu saja\" in subsequent sections if the repetition becomes noticeable. Consider using alternatives like \"Tentu,\" \"Memang,\" or simply omitting it if the context makes it clear.\n*   While \"ujarku\" is correct, consider if a more colloquial option like \"Aku bilang\" would fit the narrator's voice better, depending on the overall tone of the novel. This is a minor point and depends on the desired level of formality.\n*   Consider adding a slight pause or more descriptive language after \"di tempat yang terpencil\" to enhance the imagery. For example, \"di sebuah tempat yang terpencil, jauh dari keramaian...\" (in a secluded place, far from the crowds...). This is optional and depends on the desired flow.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\npass",

The intent is to convey a covered drop-off area.  Alternatives:\n    *   \"Di bagian belakang, akan ada area teras tertutup untuk mobil, supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.\" (A covered patio area for cars...)\n    *   \"Di bagian belakang, akan ada ruang tunggu mobil, sehingga kamu bisa turun dari mobil langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan.\" (A waiting area for cars...)\n    *   A more descriptive phrase is needed to convey the meaning.\n*   \"There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room.\" -> \"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan meletakkannya di ruang keluarga.\" - \"Lihat?\" (see?) is a little too direct and sounds unnatural. \"Bisa\" (can) is missing.  \"Atau mungkin aku akan meletakkannya di ruang keluarga, *mungkin*.\"\n*   \"That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck.

        "feedback": "--- EVALUATION ---\n\n**Overall Coherence:** The translation is generally understandable but lacks natural flow and several key improvements could be made to enhance readability and cultural appropriateness. The tone is slightly stilted.\n\n**Clause-by-Clause/Phrase-by-Phrase Analysis:**\n\n*   \"It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room.\" -> \"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.\" - This is a direct and accurate translation. No issues.\n\n*   \"There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it.\" -> \"Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya.\" - Accurate, but \"kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya\" sounds a bit formal. A more natural phrasing might be \"dengan kamar mandi yang persis di sampingnya\" or \"dengan kamar mandi yang dekat sekali.\"\n\n*   \"I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger.\" -> \"Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jari.\" - Accurate.\n\n*   \"Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet.\" -> \"Di bagian belakang, akan ada *carport* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.\" - The use of \"*carport*\" is a good choice, as it's a more common and understandable term than a literal translation of *porte cochere*. However, the sentence structure is a bit clunky. Consider: \"Di bagian belakang rumah, akan ada *carport* untuk mobil. Jadi, kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan.\" (At the back of the house, there will be a carport for cars. So you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)\n\n*   \"There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room.\" -> \"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di ruang keluarga.\" - \"Lihat?\" is a bit awkward. It could be replaced with \"bisa juga\" (could also) or simply omitted.\n\n*   \"That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.\" -> \"Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak.\" - Accurate, but the repetition of \"Dan kamu bisa...\" (And you can...) is repetitive and less elegant. A better phrasing would be: \"Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan teras itu bisa digunakan untuk menyimpan kayu bakar dan pemanggang gas, untuk memanggang steak.\" (That's where the fireplace will be, and the deck can be used to store firewood and a gas grill, for grilling steaks.)\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n\n*   The translation is overly literal in places, resulting in sentences that don't flow naturally in Indonesian.\n*   The repetition of \"Aku bisa...\" is a stylistic weakness.\n*   The phrase \"lihat?\" is informal and disrupts the flow.\n*   The use of \"tepat di sebelahnya\" is slightly formal and could be replaced with a more natural phrasing.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   Focus on creating more natural-sounding sentences by restructuring phrases.\n*   Avoid unnecessary repetition.\n*   Replace overly formal phrasing with more conversational alternatives.\n*   Consider adding transitional words to improve flow.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\n\nfail",
