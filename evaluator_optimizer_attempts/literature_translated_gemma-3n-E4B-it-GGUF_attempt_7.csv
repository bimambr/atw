nuance_preservation: False",needs_revision,"While the translation demonstrates reasonable semantic accuracy – the core meaning of the text is conveyed – it unfortunately fails on several crucial fronts. The tone is a significant issue. ""Bunuh diri, masa bodoh"" translates ""Suicide, my ass"" literally, but the Indonesian phrasing lacks the sarcastic, cynical, and dismissive tone of the original. ""Masa bodoh"" implies indifference or a lack of concern, which isn't quite the same as the original's contemptuous rejection of the idea of suicide. This tonal mismatch significantly weakens the impact of the opening line. 

Furthermore, the translation misses the nuance of the phrase ""wild girlfriend."" ""Pacar gila"" is a very literal translation of ""crazy girlfriend,"" which doesn't capture the implied rebellious or unconventional nature of the relationship. This lack of nuance diminishes the overall richness of the text. 

The fluency is acceptable, though a more natural phrasing could be achieved. However, the tonal and nuance failures are critical. A successful translation must not only convey the literal meaning but also replicate the author's voice and the subtle complexities of the original. Therefore, this translation requires significant revision to better capture the intended tone and nuances of the source text.
