Saya menatap wajah tegas seorang wakil. “Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,” kataku.",needs_revision,"**1. Identify Flaws:**

*   **""Bunuh diri, omong kosong""**: While conveying the general sentiment, ""omong kosong"" (nonsense) is a bit too informal and lacks the sharp, cynical edge of ""my ass."" It's a softening of the original's tone.
*   **""mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal and clunky. ""Makamnya"" (his grave) is fine, but the phrasing feels unnatural. A more natural phrasing would be something like ""pergi ke makamnya"" (go to his grave).
*   **""kekasihnya yang riang""**: ""Riang"" (cheerful, merry) doesn't quite capture the meaning of ""wild."" ""Wild"" implies a certain untamed, perhaps even reckless, quality. ""Kekasihnya yang riang"" suggests simply a happy girlfriend, which is a significant misinterpretation.
*   **""wajah tegas seorang wakil""**: ""Tegas"" (firm, resolute) is accurate, but ""intent"" in the original implies a focused, perhaps even stern, gaze. ""Tegas"" doesn't fully convey this.
*   **Overall Flow:** The translation is technically correct but lacks the punch and immediacy of the original. It reads like a standard, somewhat stiff, translation rather than one that captures the character's voice and the overall atmosphere.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""Bunuh diri, omong kosong""**: Replace ""omong kosong"" with a more impactful phrase. Consider ""Bisa surut!"" (Could have retreated!) or ""Tidak mungkin!"" (Impossible!) to capture the dismissive tone.
*   **""mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu""**: Change to ""pergi ke makamnya"" for a more natural flow.
*   **""kekasihnya yang riang""**: Replace ""riang"" with a word that conveys ""wildness"" or ""recklessness."" Options include ""gila"" (crazy), ""liar"" (wild), or ""bebas"" (free-spirited), depending on the nuance desired.
*   **""wajah tegas seorang wakil""**: Consider ""wajah serius seorang wakil"" (serious face of a deputy) or ""wajah tajam seorang wakil"" (sharp face of a deputy) to better convey the intended meaning.
*   **General:** Focus on capturing the character's voice. The translation should sound like something *this* character would say, not a neutral observer. Consider using more colloquial language where appropriate, while maintaining a level of formality suitable for the setting.

Saya menatap wajah serius seorang wakil. “Bukan bunuh diri,” kataku.",needs_revision,"**1. Identify Flaws:**

*   **""Masa bodoh"" for ""my ass"":** While ""masa bodoh"" can convey a dismissive attitude, it's a very different register and carries a much weaker, more polite connotation than the original ""my ass."" It loses the bluntness and vulgarity intended.
*   **""Pacarnya yang bebas"" for ""his wild girlfriend"":** ""Bebas"" translates to ""free"" or ""unrestrained."" While it hints at the wildness, it's a very indirect and somewhat awkward way to describe a ""wild girlfriend."" It lacks the evocative quality of the original.
*   **""Wakil"" for ""deputy"":** ""Wakil"" generally means ""deputy"" or ""vice."" While technically correct, it's a bit formal and lacks the casual feel of ""deputy"" in this context.
*   **Overall Tone:** The Indonesian translation feels slightly too formal and lacks the gritty, informal tone of the original. The word choices are safe but fail to capture the character's cynical and world-weary voice. The sentence structure is also a bit clunky in places.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""My ass"":** Consider options like ""Sial,"" ""Nggak mungkin,"" or ""Bisa mati?"" depending on the desired level of bluntness. ""Sial"" is a common curse word, ""Nggak mungkin"" is more colloquial and expresses disbelief, and ""Bisa mati?"" is a more sarcastic way of saying ""seriously?"".
*   **""His wild girlfriend"":**  Replace ""pacarnya yang bebas"" with something more descriptive and evocative, such as ""pacarnya yang suka berbuat onar"" (his girlfriend who likes to cause trouble), ""pacarnya yang nakal"" (his naughty girlfriend), or ""pacarnya yang liar"" (his wild girlfriend - closer to the original but still needs refinement).
*   **""Deputy"":**  Use a more colloquial term like ""kepala polisi"" (police chief) or, if appropriate for the setting, a more informal term for a law enforcement officer. Alternatively, ""wakil"" is acceptable, but it should be used with a more casual tone in the surrounding sentences.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Rephrase some sentences for better flow and naturalness. For example, ""Saya membuka mata"" could be smoother as ""Saya membuka mata dan..."" (I opened my eyes and...).

Identify Flaws:**

*   **""Sial!"" (Damn!)**: While conveying a similar sentiment to ""Suicide, my ass,"" it lacks the sarcastic, dismissive tone of the original. ""Suicide, my ass"" is a very specific, colloquial expression of disbelief and cynicism. ""Sial!"" is too general.
*   **""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh saya lihat makamnya dulu..."" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to see his grave first...)**: The phrasing is grammatically correct but feels overly formal and lacks the casual, almost annoyed tone of the original. The use of ""suruh"" (to order/ask) is a bit stiff.
*   **""...daripada dikirim ke hutan nyari Teenie?"" (...instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?)**: The word ""nyari"" (to search for) is colloquial and slightly less formal than the original. While not inherently wrong, it doesn't quite capture the same level of casual frustration.
*   **""Jelas-jelas cowok ini nggak mungkin bunuh diri."" (Clearly, this guy couldn't have committed suicide.)**: ""Jelas-jelas"" (clearly) is a bit redundant. The original's ""Of course this boy hadn't shot himself"" is more concise and impactful. The phrasing is also slightly less natural.
*   **""Dell Teague dibunuh, kayak pacarnya yang suka bikin masalah."" (Dell Teague was murdered, like his troublemaking girlfriend.)**: The phrase ""suka bikin masalah"" (likes to cause problems) is a bit clunky and less evocative than ""wild girlfriend."" It lacks the same punch and implies a different kind of ""wildness.""
*   **""Saya melirik wajah serius si kepala polisi itu."" (I glanced at the serious face of the police chief.)**: ""Melirik"" (to glance) is a bit weak. ""Looked at"" or ""observed"" would be stronger and more appropriate. ""Si kepala polisi itu"" (that police chief) is also slightly awkward.
*   **""Nggak mungkin bunuh diri,"" jawab saya. (""Couldn't have committed suicide,"" I replied.)**: The use of ""Nggak mungkin"" (can't be possible) is a bit too literal and lacks the subtle sarcasm of the original. ""No suicide here,"" is more direct and impactful.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""Sial!""**: Replace with a more sarcastic and dismissive phrase like ""Pasti bukan bunuh diri!"" (Definitely not a suicide!) or ""Ah, sudahlah!"" (Oh, forget it!) depending on the desired nuance.
*   **""...daripada dikirim ke hutan nyari Teenie?""**: Rephrase to something like ""...daripada dikirim ke hutan buat nyari Teenie?"" (instead of being sent to the woods to look for Teenie?) or ""...daripada disuruh nyari Teenie di hutan?"" (instead of being told to look for Teenie in the woods?).
*   **""Jelas-jelas cowok ini nggak mungkin bunuh diri.""**: Change to ""Tentu saja dia nggak bunuh diri."" (Of course he didn't commit suicide.) or ""Nggak mungkin dia bunuh diri."" (He couldn't have committed suicide.)

The Indonesian translation suffers from several flaws. Firstly, the informal tone (""*Paling juga*"") feels jarring and doesn't quite capture the cynical, world-weary attitude of the original. While informality is present in the source, the Indonesian translation leans too heavily into it, potentially undermining the character's established voice. Secondly, the use of ""wakil"" for ""deputy"" is technically correct but lacks the punch and familiarity of a more specific term. ""Wakil"" is too generic. Thirdly, the sentence structure in places is overly simplified and lacks the nuance of the original. For example, ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama kayak pacarnya yang liar itu"" is grammatically correct but feels clunky and less impactful than the original's phrasing. The use of ""itu"" (that) is unnecessary and weakens the sentence. Finally, the overall register feels inconsistent. The translation attempts to be colloquial, but it occasionally slips into a more formal tone, creating an awkward reading experience. The use of ""udah"" (already) is also overly casual and doesn't quite fit the context.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""Bunuh diri? Paling juga""**: Consider replacing ""*Paling juga*"" with something that better conveys the sarcastic dismissal. Options include: ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*"" (Suicide? Don't be foolish.) or ""*Bunuh diri? Masa sih.*"" (Suicide? Seriously?)
*   **""Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, daripada dikirim ke hutan nyari Teenie?""**: This sentence is a bit long and convoluted. Consider breaking it into two shorter sentences for clarity: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya untuk melihat makamnya terlebih dahulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?"" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to see his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?)
*   **""Aku lihat muka tajam wakilnya.""**: Replace ""tajam"" with a more descriptive word that captures the ""intent"" aspect of the original. Options include: ""Aku lihat wajah serius wakil itu."" (I saw the serious face of the deputy.) or ""Aku lihat ekspresi tegas wakil itu."" (I saw the firm expression of the deputy.)
*   **Overall Tone:** Strive for a more consistent level of informality. While the original is informal, the translation occasionally veers into overly casual territory. Aim for a tone that is cynical and world-weary, but not overly slangy.
*   **""udah""**: Remove the use of ""udah"" in ""Hollis Boxleitner udah belok"". It's unnecessary and detracts from the overall quality.

*   **""Bunuh diri, omong kosong""**: While ""omong kosong"" translates to ""nonsense,"" it's a bit too informal and lacks the sarcastic bite of ""my ass."" It's a significant tonal mismatch.
*   **""reaksi instan, dan terdiam""**: The phrasing is clunky. ""Reaksi instan"" is redundant with ""dan terdiam"" (and silent). It feels unnatural in Indonesian.
*   **""mengunjungi makamnya""**: ""Mengunjungi makamnya"" (to visit his grave) is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal and stiff. A more natural phrasing would be something like ""pergi ke makamnya"" (to go to his grave).
*   **""wakil dari kepolisian tersebut""**: This is overly verbose. ""Wakil kepolisian"" (police deputy) is sufficient and more natural. ""Tersebut"" (that/the aforementioned) is unnecessary.
*   **""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil dari kepolisian tersebut.""**: The sentence structure is awkward. The placement of ""serius"" (serious) feels unnatural and disrupts the flow.
*   **Overall Register:** The Indonesian translation leans towards a more formal register than the original English, which is quite informal and uses colloquialisms. This creates a disconnect in tone.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""Bunuh diri, omong kosong""**: Replace ""omong kosong"" with a more impactful and colloquial phrase. Consider ""Bisa-bisa bunuh diri, *sial*!""

Hollis Boxleitner udah ngelilingin buat lihat apa yang saya lakuin. Saya lihat muka serius wakil kepolisian itu. “Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini,” kata saya.",needs_revision,"**1. Identify Flaws:**

The Indonesian translation suffers from several flaws. Firstly, the informal tone (""*Siallah*,"" ""udah jelas,"" ""nggak"") clashes with the somewhat detached and observant voice of the original. While informality might be appropriate in some contexts, it feels overly casual here and undermines the gravity of the situation. Secondly, the use of colloquialisms like ""nyari"" (to search for) and ""ngelilingin"" (to circle around) are too informal and lack the nuance of the original. The translation lacks a certain level of polish and sophistication. Thirdly, the phrasing ""muka serius wakil kepolisian itu"" (the serious face of the police deputy) is clunky and unnatural. A more idiomatic expression would be preferable. Finally, the direct translation of ""No suicide here"" as ""Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini"" is grammatically correct but lacks the impact and authority of the original.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

Here's a breakdown of suggested improvements:

*   **""Bunuh diri? *Siallah*.""**: Consider replacing ""*Siallah*"" with a more understated expression of disbelief or annoyance, such as ""*Tidak mungkin*."" or ""*Sial*."" depending on the desired level of informality.
*   **""Kenapa Sybil tidak suruh saya lihat makamnya dulu, daripada kirim ke hutan nyari Teenie?""**: This needs restructuring for better flow. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Mengapa Sybil tidak meminta saya untuk melihat makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?""
*   **""Udah jelas cowok ini nggak bunuh diri.""**: Replace with: ""Jelas sekali bahwa pemuda ini tidak melakukan bunuh diri."" or ""Tidak mungkin pemuda ini melakukan bunuh diri.""
*   **""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama kayak pacarnya yang gila itu.""**: This is acceptable, but could be improved. ""Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacarnya yang eksentrik."" is slightly more sophisticated.
*   **""Saya buka mata. Hollis Boxleitner udah ngelilingin buat lihat apa yang saya lakuin.""**: Replace with: ""Saya membuka mata. Hollis Boxleitner telah berbalik untuk melihat apa yang sedang saya lakukan.""
*   **""Saya lihat muka serius wakil kepolisian itu.""**: Replace with: ""Saya melihat wajah serius wakil kepolisian itu."" or ""Saya memperhatikan ekspresi serius wakil kepolisian itu.""
*   **“Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini,” kata saya.** Replace with: ""Tidak ada tanda-tanda bunuh diri di sini,"" saya berkata.

*   **""Sungkan"" (Hesitant/Reluctant) is a poor translation of ""my instant, and silent reaction.""** While it conveys a sense of reluctance, it doesn't capture the immediate, visceral nature of the original. ""Instant"" implies a quick, automatic response, and ""silent"" suggests an internal reaction. ""Sungkan"" implies a feeling of awkwardness or embarrassment, which is not present in the original.
*   **""demikian"" (thus/so) is a weak connector.** It's grammatically correct but lacks the punch and immediacy of ""was."" It feels overly formal and doesn't quite capture the abruptness of the original.
*   **""pemuda ini"" (this young man) is slightly awkward.** While not incorrect, it's a bit clunky. ""This boy"" is more natural in Indonesian.
*   **""pacarnya yang eksentrik"" (his eccentric girlfriend) is a literal translation and lacks nuance.** While accurate, it doesn't quite capture the implied rebellious or unconventional nature of ""wild."" ""Eksentrik"" can sometimes imply harmless oddness, not the potentially dangerous or untamed quality of ""wild.""
*   **""wakil kepolisian itu"" (that police deputy) is overly verbose.** ""Wakil kepolisian"" is a bit redundant. ""Wakil"" already implies a police officer. ""Itu"" (that) is often unnecessary and makes the sentence less fluid.
*   **""Tidak ada tanda-tanda bunuh diri di sini"" (There are no signs of suicide here) is a bit too literal.** While understandable, it lacks the slightly more emphatic tone of ""No suicide here."" It's a bit passive.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   Replace ""Sungkan"" with a phrase that conveys immediacy and internal reaction. Consider options like ""Reaksi pertama saya adalah *begitu*,"" (My first reaction was *that*), or ""Reaksi pertama saya adalah *langsung*,"" (My first reaction was *immediate*).
*   Replace ""demikian"" with ""adalah"" (is) or rephrase the sentence to avoid the weak connector altogether. For example: ""Reaksi pertama saya adalah: *Bunuh diri?*"" (My first reaction was: Suicide?).
*   Replace ""pemuda ini"" with ""anak ini"" (this boy) or simply omit it if the context is clear.
*   Consider alternatives to ""pacarnya yang eksentrik."" Options include: ""pacarnya yang liar"" (his wild girlfriend), ""pacarnya yang pemberontak"" (his rebellious girlfriend), or ""pacarnya yang sulit diprediksi"" (his unpredictable girlfriend). The best choice depends on the specific nuance desired.
*   Simplify ""wakil kepolisian itu"" to ""wakil polisi"" (police deputy) or even just ""wakil"" (deputy) if the context makes it clear.
*   Rephrase ""Tidak ada tanda-tanda bunuh diri di sini"" to something more direct and emphatic, such as ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini"" (There is no suicide here) or ""Bukan bunuh diri."" (Not a suicide).

*   **""penipu ulung"" (master swindler):** While conveying the general idea of a ""confidence trickster,"" it's overly dramatic and doesn't quite capture the nuance of someone who is being *perceived* as a trickster, rather than actively *being* one. It implies a level of skill and malicious intent not necessarily present in the original.
*   **""menyentuh kecerdasan saya"" (touch my intelligence):** This is a very awkward and unnatural phrasing. ""Quick"" in this context refers to wit, cleverness, or quick thinking. ""Intelligence"" is too broad and doesn't convey the intended meaning.
*   **""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (blemish our honor):** This is a somewhat formal and literary way of saying ""impugn our honor."" While not strictly incorrect, it lacks the directness and slightly aggressive tone of the original.
*   **Overall Tone:** The Indonesian translation feels slightly more formal and less colloquial than the original English. The word choices lean towards a more literary register, which might not be appropriate for the context of a novel excerpt.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""penipu ulung""**: Replace with something more neutral and closer to the original meaning. Options include: ""seolah-olah saya sedang menipu"" (as if I were deceiving someone), ""diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" (treated like someone trying to deceive), or ""dianggap sebagai penipu"" (considered a trickster).
*   **""menyentuh kecerdasan saya""**: Replace with a more idiomatic and accurate phrase. Options include: ""menguji kecerdasan saya"" (test my wit), ""menggertak saya dengan kecerdasan saya"" (threaten me with my wit), or ""memprovokasi saya dengan kecerdasan saya"" (provoke me with my wit).
*   **""mencoreng kehormatan kami""**: Replace with a more direct and impactful phrase. Options include: ""menuduh kami tidak jujur"" (accuse us of dishonesty), ""merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (belittle our honor), or ""mengancam reputasi kami"" (threaten our reputation).
*   **Tone Adjustment:** Consider using more colloquial language and sentence structures to better match the original's tone. Avoid overly formal vocabulary where possible.

The translation contains several flaws.

*   **""menipu"" (deceiving/tricking) vs. ""confidence trickster"":** While ""menipu"" is a valid translation of ""trickster,"" it lacks the nuance of a ""confidence trickster,"" which implies a more sophisticated and calculated form of deception. The original text suggests a specific type of manipulation, and ""menipu"" is too general.
*   **""menguji kecerdasan saya"" (testing my intelligence) vs. ""touch my quick"":** This is a significant misinterpretation. ""Touch my quick"" is a colloquialism meaning to get to someone's nerve, to provoke them, or to push their buttons. ""Menguji kecerdasan saya"" is a literal translation that completely misses the intended meaning.
*   **""tidak jujur"" (dishonest) vs. ""impugn our honor"":** ""Impugn our honor"" is a much stronger and more specific phrase than ""tidak jujur."" ""Impugn"" means to attack the reputation or integrity of someone. ""Tidak jujur"" is a weak and inadequate substitute.
*   **Tonal Inconsistency:** The overall tone of the Indonesian translation is slightly more formal and less impactful than the original English. The phrasing feels somewhat stiff.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

Here's how the translator could improve the text:

*   **""menipu"" -> ""menipu dengan licik"" (deceiving cunningly) or ""memainkan orang"" (playing people):** These options better capture the sense of a confidence trickster.
*   **""menguji kecerdasan saya"" -> ""memancing emosi saya"" (provoking my emotions) or ""menggali aib saya"" (digging up my past/weaknesses):** These options more accurately convey the meaning of ""touch my quick.""
*   **""tidak jujur"" -> ""merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (belittling our honor) or ""menuduh kami melakukan kesalahan"" (accusing us of wrongdoing):** These options are stronger and more appropriate for the context.
*   **Re-evaluate sentence structure:** The sentences could be restructured for a more natural and impactful flow in Indonesian. Consider using more idiomatic expressions.

*   **""titik lemah saya"" (my weak point):** This is a literal translation and lacks the idiomatic feel of ""quick."" ""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's vulnerability, sensitivity, or core emotional center. ""Titik lemah"" is too broad and doesn't convey the same depth.
*   **""mencoreng reputasi kami"" (blemish our reputation):** This is a somewhat formal and indirect way of saying ""impugn our honor."" ""Impugn"" implies a direct attack on one's character or integrity, which is stronger than simply ""blemishing"" a reputation.
*   **Overall Tone:** The Indonesian translation feels slightly more formal and less visceral than the original English. The phrasing is a bit stiff and lacks the immediacy of the source text.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""dimanfaatkan dengan cara licik""**: Replace with something more evocative like ""diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" (treated like a cunning swindler) or ""diperlakukan seperti orang yang dimanfaatkan"" (treated like someone being taken advantage of), depending on the desired emphasis.
*   **""titik lemah saya""**: Replace with a more idiomatic expression like ""hati nurani saya"" (my conscience), ""jiwa saya"" (my soul), or ""bagian paling rentan saya"" (my most vulnerable part). The best choice depends on the specific context and the character's personality.

""Quick"" in this context refers to a person's vulnerability, their emotional core, their sensitivity. ""Inti diri saya"" is too abstract and lacks the emotional weight.
*   **""mencemarkan kehormatan kami"" (defame our honor):** This is a somewhat formal and legalistic phrasing. While accurate, it lacks the immediacy and emotional impact of ""impugn our honor."" ""Impugn"" implies a direct attack on character and integrity, which is stronger than simply ""defame.""
*   **Overall Tone:** The Indonesian translation feels slightly stiff and formal compared to the original English. The phrasing is grammatically correct but lacks the natural flow and slightly cynical tone of the source text.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""dimanfaatkan"" -> ""dipermainkan"" (played/manipulated):** This captures the sense of being tricked and manipulated more accurately than ""dimanfaatkan.""
*   **""inti diri saya"" -> ""bagian paling rentan dari diri saya"" (the most vulnerable part of myself) or ""jiwa saya"" (my soul):** These options better convey the emotional vulnerability implied by ""quick.""
*   **""mencemarkan kehormatan kami"" -> ""menuduh kami tidak jujur"" (accuse us of dishonesty) or ""meragukan integritas kami"" (doubt our integrity):** These options are more direct and emotionally resonant than ""mencemarkan kehormatan kami.""
*   **General:** Focus on using more idiomatic Indonesian expressions that capture the subtle nuances of the English. Aim for a more conversational and slightly cynical tone.

*   **""di luar jalur yang umum""**: While understandable, this is a rather clunky and less natural way to say ""off the beaten road."" A more idiomatic translation would be preferable.
*   **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a literal translation and sounds awkward. ""Inconveniences"" could be better conveyed with a phrase like ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings) or ""kesulitan"" (difficulties).
*   **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is grammatically correct but lacks flow. ""Tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" would be smoother.
*   **""sehingga Anda dapat membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah""**: This is overly formal and verbose. A more natural phrasing would be ""sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan"" or ""sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah kuyup.""
*   **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is a bit stiff. ""Di sanalah perapian akan terletak"" or simply ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" is better.
*   **Repetitive use of ""akan ada""**: The phrase ""akan ada"" (there will be) is repeated several times, making the text sound monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow.
*   **Register**: The overall register is slightly formal, which doesn't quite match the conversational tone of the original.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   Replace ""di luar jalur yang umum"" with ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a secluded place) or ""di luar kota"" (outside the city).

*   Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive use of ""akan ada."" For example, instead of ""Akan ada dapur di sini..."", try ""Dapur akan berada di sini..."" or ""Di sini akan ada dapur...""

*   **""jauh dari keramaian"" (far from the bustle):** While understandable, this is a rather generic translation of ""off the beaten road."" It lacks the evocative quality of the original. ""Off the beaten road"" implies a sense of seclusion and perhaps a bit of adventure, which ""jauh dari keramaian"" doesn't fully capture.
*   **""dengan kenyamanan modern"" (with modern comfort):** This is a clunky and somewhat unnatural phrasing. The original implies a desire for the *advantages* of a modern home *while retaining* the aesthetic of a log cabin. ""Dengan kenyamanan modern"" suggests a simple addition of modern amenities, not a careful balance.
*   **""rancangannya"" (its design):** While grammatically correct, ""rancangannya"" feels a bit formal and stiff. A more natural phrasing might be ""gambaran"" (the blueprint/plan) or ""desainnya"" (its design).
*   **""tepat di samping kamar mandi"" (directly next to the bathroom):** This is a literal translation and sounds awkward in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be ""berdekatan dengan kamar mandi"" (close to the bathroom) or ""dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan"" (with an adjacent bathroom).
*   **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" (That's where the fireplace will be):** This is a bit redundant. ""Di sanalah"" (that's where) is unnecessary. A simpler phrasing would be ""Perapian akan berada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there).
*   **""Dan Anda bisa memanggang steak di sana"" (And you can grill steak there):** The use of ""Anda"" (you - formal) is inconsistent with the rest of the translation, which uses a more informal ""ku"" (I - informal). This creates a jarring tonal shift. Also, ""memanggang steak"" is a bit formal; ""memanggang daging steak"" or simply ""memanggang steak"" is more common.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""off the beaten road"":** Replace ""jauh dari keramaian"" with something like ""terpencil"" (remote), ""di luar jalur umum"" (outside the common path), or ""di tempat yang sepi"" (in a quiet place).

*   **""di luar jalur utama""**: While understandable, ""di luar jalur utama"" is a bit clunky and less evocative than a more natural phrasing. A better option would be something like ""di pinggiran kota"" (on the outskirts of the city) or ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place).
*   **""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya""**: The repetition of ""pondok kayu"" (log cabin) followed by ""yang sebenarnya"" (the real one) is redundant and awkward. It could be simplified to ""pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu."" (a log cabin, but without the inconveniences typically found in log cabins).
*   **""berseerta ruang keluarga""**: ""Beserta"" is a bit formal and less common in everyday speech. ""dan"" (and) would be more natural.
*   **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""tepat di sebelah"" (right next to) would be more natural.
*   **""Di bagian belakang""**: While not incorrect, it's a bit abrupt. A smoother transition would be ""Di bagian belakang rumah,"" (At the back of the house).
*   **""sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah""**: This is overly formal and verbose. A more natural phrasing would be ""sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan"" (so you can bring groceries directly to the kitchen without getting wet).
*   **""lihat?""**: The inclusion of ""lihat?"" (see?) is a direct translation of the English and feels unnatural in Indonesian. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence to convey the same meaning without the tag question.
*   **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: Similar to the previous point, this is a direct translation and sounds unnatural. ""Di sanalah perapian akan ditempatkan"" (That's where the fireplace will be placed) or simply ""Di sanalah perapiannya"" (That's where the fireplace is) would be better.
*   **""Untuk steak""**: While understandable, it's a bit abrupt. Adding a slight softening phrase like ""tentu saja, untuk memanggang steak"" (of course, to grill steaks) would improve the flow.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   Replace ""di luar jalur utama"" with ""di pinggiran kota"" or ""di tempat yang terpencil.""
*   Rephrase ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" to ""pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu.""
*   Replace ""berseerta"" with ""dan.""
*   Replace ""tepat di sampingnya"" with ""tepat di sebelah.""
*   Add ""Di bagian belakang rumah,"" for a smoother transition.
*   Rephrase ""sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" to ""sehingga Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan.""
*   Omit ""lihat?"" or rephrase the sentence.
*   Rephrase ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" to ""Di sanalah perapian akan ditempatkan"" or ""Di sanalah perapiannya.""

*   **""di pinggiran kota"" (on the outskirts of the city):** While not strictly *wrong*, it's a slightly clunky and less natural way to express ""off the beaten road"" in this context. ""di lokasi yang terpencil"" (in a remote location) or ""di luar jalur utama"" (outside the main path) would be more idiomatic.
*   **""ketidaknyamanan yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (the inconveniences that are usually present in log cabins):** This is overly literal and awkward. It lacks the flow and conciseness of the original. A better phrasing would be something like ""dengan semua kekurangan pondok kayu"" (with all the drawbacks of a log cabin) or ""tanpa masalah yang umum ditemukan pada pondok kayu"" (without the common problems found in log cabins).
*   **""tepat di sebelah ruang keluarga"" (right next to the family room):** This is a bit too literal. ""berdekatan dengan ruang keluarga"" (adjacent to the family room) or ""bersebelahan dengan ruang keluarga"" (next to the family room) would be more natural.
*   **""di sisi kanan dapur"" (on the right side of the kitchen):** This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""di samping dapur"" (beside the kitchen) is more natural.
*   **Repetitive use of ""Dan tentu saja"" (And of course):** While the original uses it sparingly, the Indonesian translation repeats it unnecessarily, making the text feel less polished.
*   **""Anda bisa"" (You can):** The repeated use of ""Anda bisa"" feels overly formal and somewhat unnatural in this conversational context. Using a more informal phrasing like ""Kamu bisa"" (You can) or simply omitting it where the meaning is clear would improve the flow.
*   **""panggangan gas"" (gas grill):** While understandable, ""barbekyu gas"" (gas barbecue) is a more common and natural term in Indonesian.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""","“Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,” kata Hollis, tersenyum.

“Baiklah,” ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku bicarakan. “Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di pinggir kota. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kekurangan pondok kayu sungguhan. Aku menemukan rancangannya di Internet, dan aku membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.”

“Tentu saja,” katanya, sambil menyesap bir.

Di sana akan ada dua kamar tidur, ruang kerja, dan ruang keluarga. Akan ada dapur, berdekatan dengan kamar mandi. Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku. “Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur. Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga. Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.”",needs_revision,"**1. Identify Flaws:**

*   **""di pinggir kota""**: While understandable, ""di pinggir kota"" (on the outskirts of the city) is a bit clunky and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning of ""off the beaten road."" It implies a distance from the city center, not necessarily a secluded or unconventional location.
*   **""pondok kayu""**: ""Pondok kayu"" (wooden hut) is a literal translation of ""log cabin"" but lacks the charm and specific connotation of a log cabin. It's too generic.
*   **""kekurangan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a bit wordy. ""Inconveniences of a real log cabin"" could be more concisely expressed.
*   **""berdekatan dengan kamar mandi""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it"" and sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A more idiomatic expression is needed.
*   **""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal and slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be preferable.
*   **Repetitive use of ""akan ada""**: The phrase ""akan ada"" (there will be) is repeated multiple times, making the text sound monotonous.
*   **""panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak""**: While understandable, this is a bit verbose. ""Untuk memanggang steak"" is redundant as it's already implied by ""panggangan gas.""

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""off the beaten road""**: Replace ""di pinggir kota"" with a phrase that conveys seclusion or unconventionality. Options include: ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place), ""di lokasi yang tidak biasa"" (in an unusual location), or ""di tempat yang jauh dari keramaian"" (in a place far from the crowds).
*   **""log cabin""**: Replace ""pondok kayu"" with a more evocative term. Consider ""rumah kayu bergaya pondok"" (log cabin-style house) or ""rumah kayu tradisional"" (traditional wooden house).
*   **""inconveniences of a real log cabin""**: Rephrase to something like: ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya dihadapi dengan rumah kayu sungguhan"" (but without the usual problems associated with a real wooden house) or ""tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan rumah kayu biasa"" (but without the inconveniences of a typical wooden house).
*   **""right off of it""**: Replace ""berdekatan dengan kamar mandi"" with a more natural phrase like: ""dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan"" (with a bathroom that is adjacent) or ""dengan kamar mandi yang tepat di sampingnya"" (with a bathroom right next to it).
*   **""supaya kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah""**: Rephrase to: ""agar Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan"" (so you can bring groceries directly to the kitchen without getting wet) or ""agar Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur, bahkan saat hujan"" (so you can bring groceries directly to the kitchen, even when it's raining).
*   **Vary sentence structure**: Avoid repeating ""akan ada."" Use synonyms or rephrase sentences to create a more fluid reading experience.
*   **""panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak""**: Simplify to: ""panggangan gas di teras untuk memanggang steak"" or ""panggangan gas di teras untuk memasak steak.""

*   **""di tempat yang terpencil""**: While ""terpencil"" means remote, it lacks the nuance of ""off the beaten road."" It's a more general term and doesn't convey the sense of seclusion and deliberate distance implied in the original.
*   **""rumah kayu bergaya pondok""**: This is a literal translation of ""log cabin style"" and sounds somewhat clunky in Indonesian. A more natural phrasing would be something like ""rumah bergaya pondok kayu"" or ""rumah yang menyerupai pondok kayu.""
*   **""masalah yang biasanya dihadapi dengan rumah kayu sungguhan""**: This is overly verbose and awkward. ""Inconveniences"" is better conveyed with a simpler phrase like ""kesulitan"" (difficulties) or ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings).
*   **""bersebelahan""**: While technically correct for ""right off of it,"" it's a bit formal and doesn't quite capture the casual tone of the original. ""tepat di samping"" or ""sangat dekat"" would be more appropriate.
*   **""Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan""**: This is overly formal (""Anda"") and a bit cumbersome. A more natural phrasing would be ""Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" or ""Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur, terlindung dari hujan.""
*   **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The frequent use of ""di"" (at/in) makes the sentences feel choppy and less fluid.
*   **""untuk memanggang steak""**: While understandable, it's a bit formal. ""Untuk memasak steak"" would be more natural.

**2. Suggest Improvements:**

*   **""off the beaten road""**: Replace ""di tempat yang terpencil"" with ""di luar jalur utama"" or ""tersembunyi.""
*   **""log cabin style""**: Replace ""rumah kayu bergaya pondok"" with ""rumah bergaya pondok kayu"" or ""rumah yang menyerupai pondok kayu.""
*   **""inconveniences""**: Replace ""masalah yang biasanya dihadapi dengan rumah kayu sungguhan"" with ""kesulitan"" or ""kekurangan.""

*   **""without getting wet""**: Replace ""tanpa terkena hujan"" with ""tanpa basah"" or ""terlindung dari hujan.""
*   **Sentence Structure**: Rephrase sentences to improve flow and reduce the overuse of ""di.""
*   **Formality**: Adjust the level of formality to match the casual tone of the original. Consider using ""kamu"" instead of ""Anda"" where appropriate.
*   **""untuk memanggang steak""**: Replace with ""untuk memasak steak.""
