The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characterized by the use of the phrase ""Suicide, my ass,"" which expresses disbelief and sarcasm. The style is direct and conversational, typical of a detective narrating their thoughts. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide and believes foul play is involved. The language is relatively simple and accessible.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and nuance of the original. The phrase ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. While understandable, it feels a bit clunky and less impactful in Indonesian. ""Omong kosong"" translates to ""nonsense,"" which is not quite the same as the original's implied contempt.

The sentence ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less natural than the original. The structure is a bit convoluted.

""Wajah serius wakil polisi itu"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy."" While accurate, ""serius"" is a bit too direct. A more natural phrasing might convey the deputy's focused and serious expression.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" - Needs a more idiomatic and sarcastic equivalent. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!"" (Suicide? Don't be foolish!) or ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin!"" (Suicide? Impossible!). The best choice depends on the desired level of informality.
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - This is grammatically correct but could be rephrased for better flow. Consider: ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya mencari Teenie di hutan?"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to search for Teenie in the woods?). Using ""memeriksa"" (to check) instead of ""mengunjungi"" (to visit) feels more natural in this context.
*   ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu."" - ""Serius"" is a bit too direct. Consider ""Saya menatap wajah wakil polisi yang penuh perhatian"" (I stared at the attentive face of the deputy) or ""Saya menatap wajah wakil polisi yang fokus"" (I stared at the focused face of the deputy).

This improves the flow and uses more natural phrasing.
*   ""Wajah serius wakil polisi itu"" could be improved to ""*Ekspresi serius wakil polisi itu*"" (The serious expression of the deputy) or ""*Wajah tegang wakil polisi itu*"" (The tense face of the deputy). ""Serius"" is accurate but ""tegang"" might better convey the feeling of focused intensity.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The tone and impact of the original are not fully captured. The language is too formal in places and lacks the colloquial feel of the source text. The suggested revisions aim to improve the natural flow and maintain the sarcastic and dismissive tone.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases and suggestions:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" could be improved to something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid.) or ""*Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.*"" (Suicide? Impossible.) These options retain the dismissive tone while sounding more natural in Indonesian.
*   ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" could be rephrased as ""*Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?*"" (Why didn't Sybil hire me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to look for Teenie?) This is more concise and flows better.
*   ""wajah serius wakil"" could be improved to ""*wajah wakil yang serius*"" (the serious face of the deputy) or ""*wajah wakil yang tegas*"" (the firm/determined face of the deputy).

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The tone and impact of the original are not fully captured. The translation is too literal in places and lacks the natural flow of Indonesian. The suggested revisions aim to improve the naturalness and convey the sarcastic tone more effectively.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong, dismissive expression. The style is direct and conversational, using contractions (""hadn't"") and a relatively simple sentence structure. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased person committed suicide. The text also establishes a sense of mystery and a slightly detached, observant narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and nuance of the original. The phrase ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. ""Omong kosong"" is a common Indonesian phrase for nonsense, but it doesn't carry the same level of contempt as the English idiom.

The sentence ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit clunky. The phrasing is a bit too formal and doesn't flow as naturally as the original. The use of ""mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu"" is overly verbose.

""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil"" is also a bit stiff. While ""serius"" translates ""intent"" in this context, it doesn't quite convey the same feeling of focused observation.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" - Needs a more impactful and sarcastic equivalent. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh,"" or ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.""
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first..."" -> ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu..."" - Simplify the phrasing. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu?"" would be more natural.
*   ""I looked into the intent face of the deputy."" -> ""Saya menatap wajah serius wakil."" - ""Menatap"" is fine, but ""wajah serius"" is a bit too literal. Consider ""Saya memperhatikan wajah wakil yang serius"" or ""Saya melihat wajah wakil yang fokus.""

needs_revision

The translation needs revision to better capture the original's tone and style. Specifically, the translator should aim for more colloquial language and a more direct, less formal phrasing. For example, replacing ""Omong kosong"" with ""Nggak mungkin"" and simplifying sentence structures will improve the naturalness and impact of the translation. The use of more evocative adjectives to describe the deputy's face will also enhance the overall effect.

The source text employs a cynical, slightly sarcastic tone. The phrase ""*Suicide, my ass*"" is a strong expression of disbelief and dismissal. The style is informal and direct, using contractions (""hadn't"") and colloquialisms (""wild girlfriend""). The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased died by suicide. The text establishes a mystery and hints at foul play.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation attempts to capture the tone and meaning, but it falls short in several areas. The phrase ""*Pintar sekali kau*, pikiranku langsung berteriak, meski dalam diam"" (""Clever of you, my mind immediately shouted, even in silence"") is a poor rendering of ""*Suicide, my ass*"". It doesn't convey the same level of disbelief and sarcasm. The Indonesian phrase is overly formal and doesn't capture the dismissive attitude of the original.

The translation of ""wild girlfriend"" as ""pacar bengalnya"" (""his crazy girlfriend"") is acceptable, but ""wild"" can also imply a more untamed, rebellious nature. ""Bengal"" leans more towards ""crazy"" or ""mad.""

The phrase ""intent face"" is translated as ""wajah serius wakilnya"" (""the serious face of the deputy""). While accurate, it lacks the nuance of ""intent,"" which suggests a focused, perhaps even determined, expression.

The overall flow is somewhat clunky. The sentence structure feels a bit unnatural in Indonesian. The use of ""wakilnya"" (his deputy) is grammatically correct but could be smoother.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""*Suicide, my ass*"" -> ""Pintar sekali kau, pikiranku langsung berteriak, meski dalam diam"" - Needs a more direct and sarcastic equivalent. Consider something like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!"" (Suicide? Don't be foolish!) or ""Tidak mungkin bunuh diri!"" (Impossible to commit suicide!).
*   ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar bengalnya"" - Consider alternatives that capture the rebellious aspect, such as ""pacar yang sulit"" (difficult girlfriend) or ""pacar yang pemberontak"" (rebellious girlfriend).
*   ""intent face"" -> ""wajah serius wakilnya"" - Consider ""wajah yang fokus"" (focused face) or ""wajah yang penuh perhatian"" (attentive face) to better convey the meaning of ""intent.""

*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie?"" -> ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - Needs streamlining and a more natural flow. Consider: ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakanku untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie?""
*   ""wild girlfriend"" -> ""pacar lamanya yang keras kepala"" - Needs a more evocative and fitting description. Consider: ""pacar yang eksentrik"" (eccentric girlfriend) or ""pacar yang bebas"" (free-spirited girlfriend).
*   ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""wajah serius seorang wakil"" - Needs to convey a sense of focused determination. Consider: ""wajah yang penuh perhatian seorang wakil"" (attentive deputy) or ""wajah yang fokus seorang wakil"" (focused deputy).

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The tone and style are not fully captured, and some phrases lack the impact and naturalness of the original. The translation is accurate in conveying the basic meaning, but it needs to be more idiomatic and evocative to truly resonate with an Indonesian reader. The suggestions above provide specific areas for improvement.

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective narrating a crime scene. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""wild girlfriend""). The style is straightforward, focusing on conveying information and the narrator's internal thoughts. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide and believes a murder has occurred.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri, omong kosong*"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. ""Omong kosong"" is a common Indonesian phrase for nonsense, but it lacks the same level of informal disdain. The sentence structure is also slightly clunky in Indonesian.

The phrase ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakanku untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal and unnatural. A more natural phrasing would be needed. The word ""pemberani"" (brave) is used to describe the girlfriend, which is not quite the intended meaning of ""wild."" ""Wild"" in this context implies a rebellious or unpredictable nature, not necessarily bravery.

""Wajah serius wakil"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy."" While understandable, it's not the most natural way to describe someone's expression. ""Wajah tegang wakil"" (tense face of the deputy) or ""Ekspresi serius wakil"" (serious expression of the deputy) would be better choices.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""*Bunuh diri, omong kosong*"" - Needs a more impactful and informal equivalent. Consider something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!*"" or ""*Nggak mungkin bunuh diri!*""
*   ""*Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakanku untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu*"" - Needs a more natural phrasing. Consider ""*Kenapa Sybil nggak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, daripada dikirim ke hutan cari Teenie?*""
*   ""*kekasihnya yang pemberani*"" - Needs a more accurate translation of ""wild."" Consider ""*kekasihnya yang bengal*"" (mischievous) or ""*kekasihnya yang sulit diprediksi*"" (unpredictable).
*   ""*Wajah serius wakil*"" - Needs a more natural description of expression. Consider ""*Ekspresi serius wakil*"" or ""*Wajah tegang wakil*"".

(Why didn't Sybil ask me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to look for Teenie?). The use of ""meminta"" (ask) is more natural than ""mempekerjakan"" (hire) in this context.

3. ""Aku menatap wajah serius wakil."" - While grammatically correct, ""serius"" (serious) is a bit bland. Consider using a word that better conveys the deputy's intent gaze, such as ""tajam"" (sharp) or ""mengamati"" (observing). ""Aku menatap wajah tajam wakil"" or ""Aku menatap wajah wakil yang mengamati"" would be more impactful.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to better capture the original's tone and natural flow. The literal translations in the first sentence and the slightly formal phrasing in the second sentence detract from the overall impact. The third sentence could be improved by using a more descriptive adjective. The overall goal is to make the Indonesian translation sound less like a direct translation and more like a natural, engaging narrative.

Bunuh diri? *Sialan*. Reaksi pertama saya, diam-diam. Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakanku untuk memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirimku ke hutan mencari Teenie? Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri. Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar wanitanya yang sesat itu. Saya membuka mata. Hollis Boxleitner berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan. Saya menatap wajah wakil yang penuh perhitungan. ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku.

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""confidence trickster"" and ""touch my quick"" (referring to a sensitive spot or vulnerability). The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple sentence structures. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's vulnerabilities exploited. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression indicating emotional sensitivity and a feeling of being personally attacked. ""Impugn our honor"" suggests a direct and damaging attack on reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite match the original.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While accurate, it might be better to convey the feeling of being perceived as deceptive without being overly dramatic. ""Bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" is a bit redundant; ""bahkan lebih tidak suka"" would be more natural.

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf sensitif saya."" - ""Saraf sensitif saya"" (my sensitive nerves) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't quite capture the figurative meaning. A better option would be something like ""menyentuh kelemahan saya"" (touching my weakness) or ""mengusik perasaan saya"" (bothering my feelings).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a fairly accurate translation, but ""kurang berhasil"" is a bit bland. ""Tidak seberhasil"" (not as successful) would be a more natural and slightly stronger phrasing.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is accurate but sounds a bit formal. ""Menjelekkan nama baik kami"" (slandering our reputation) or ""mengurangi harga diri kami"" (diminishing our self-respect) might be more appropriate depending on the specific nuance intended. ""Kehormatan kami"" is a bit formal; ""nama baik kami"" would be more natural.

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal but also emotionally charged, particularly with the phrase ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and direct, using relatively simple language. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate and skillful deception, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and character. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit a weakness or vulnerability.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it conveys the meaning, it might be more natural to use a phrase implying deception without being overly dramatic. ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward.

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kelemahanku."" - This is a good translation. ""Kelemahanku"" (my weakness) accurately captures the meaning of ""quick"" in this context.

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good translation.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kita."" - This is a good translation, but ""mencemarkan nama baik"" (to tarnish someone's reputation) is a bit formal. A more natural alternative could be ""menghina kehormatan kita"" (to insult our honor) or ""menuduh kita tidak jujur"" (to accuse us of dishonesty), depending on the specific context.

Overall, the translation is understandable, but it lacks the subtle emotional weight and stylistic flair of the original. The phrasing in the last sentence is a bit too literal and could be improved for a more natural flow.

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal but also emotionally charged, particularly with the phrase ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and direct, using relatively simple language. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate and skillful deception, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and character. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit a weakness or vulnerability.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it conveys the meaning, it might be more natural to use a phrase implying deception without being overly dramatic. ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward.

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kelemahanku."" - This is a good translation. ""Kelemahanku"" (my weakness) accurately captures the meaning of ""quick"" in this context.

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good translation.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kita."" - This is a good translation, but ""mencemarkan nama baik"" (to tarnish someone's reputation) is a bit formal. A more natural alternative could be ""menghina kehormatan kita"" (to insult our honor) or ""menuduh kita tidak jujur"" (to accuse us of dishonesty), depending on the specific context.

Overall, the translation is understandable, but it lacks the subtle emotional weight and stylistic flair of the original. The phrasing in the last sentence is a bit too literal and could be improved for a more natural flow.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. Specifically, the phrase ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya"" could be improved to something like ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya"" or ""Aku merasa diperlakukan seperti penipu, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" The phrase ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kita"" could be improved to ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menghina kehormatan kita"" or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menuduh kita tidak jujur."" These changes will make the translation sound more natural and maintain the original meaning and tone.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of anger and resentment. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to manipulate or exploit them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, but it sounds slightly awkward in Indonesian. While understandable, it doesn't fully capture the subtle implication of a calculated deception. ""Inti saya"" is a literal translation of ""quick,"" which is not idiomatic and doesn't convey the intended meaning of vulnerability or core self. ""Mencoreng nama baik kita"" is a correct translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and could be phrased more naturally. The repetition of ""dia"" (he) is also slightly clunky.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

1. ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"": While accurate, consider alternatives that better capture the feeling of being unfairly labeled. For example, ""Saya tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu"" (I don't like being considered a trickster) or ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seolah-olah saya menipu"" (I don't like being treated as if I were deceiving).
2. ""menyentuh inti saya"": This is a literal translation and doesn't resonate. Consider ""memanipulasi saya"" (manipulate me), ""menggali kelemahan saya"" (probe my weaknesses), or ""memanfaatkan kerentanan saya"" (exploit my vulnerabilities). The best choice depends on the specific context.
3. ""mencoreng nama baik kita"": This is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal. A more natural alternative could be ""menjelekkan kita"" (to slander us) or ""merusak reputasi kita"" (to damage our reputation).
4. ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng nama baik kita"": The repetition of ""dia"" is unnecessary. It can be rephrased as ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng nama baik kita"" or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika reputasi kita dirusak.""

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) feels a bit too strong. ""Penipu"" (swindler) is more common and might be a better fit depending on the context. The phrase ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing might be ""bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya"" or ""bahkan lebih tidak senang dengan itu.""

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya."" - ""Menyentuh saraf saya"" (touch my nerves) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Saraf"" literally means nerves, but in this context, it refers to a sensitive spot or a point of vulnerability. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh titik lemah saya"" (touch my weak spot) or ""mengusik saya"" (bother me/provoke me).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good translation and acceptable.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita."" - ""Mencemarkan nama baik"" (defame someone's reputation) is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal. Depending on the context, ""menjelekkan"" (to slander/speak ill of) might be a more natural fit. Alternatively, ""mengurangi kehormatan kita"" (diminish our honor) could be used to maintain a slightly more formal tone.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to improve the naturalness and accuracy of the figurative language. Specifically:

1.  ""penipu ulung"" should be reconsidered for a more appropriate level of intensity.
2.  ""menyentuh saraf saya"" should be replaced with a phrase that better conveys the idea of a sensitive point or vulnerability, such as ""menyentuh titik lemah saya"" or ""mengusik saya.""
3.  ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" could be replaced with ""menjelekkan"" or ""mengurangi kehormatan kita"" depending on the desired tone.

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of emotional vulnerability. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression referring to being emotionally vulnerable or provoked. The overall meaning is that the speaker is offended by being manipulated and is resisting attempts to emotionally destabilize them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural flow in Indonesian.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it conveys the meaning, it might be more natural to use a phrase implying manipulation or trickery without the extreme connotation. ""Bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya"" is grammatically correct but sounds a little clunky.

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf pribadiku."" - ""Menyentuh saraf pribadiku"" (touch my personal nerves) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Saraf pribadi"" is not a common idiom and sounds unnatural. A better translation would be something like ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka memprovokasi/mengusikku"" (I retreat into myself, and I don't let them provoke/bother me). The choice between ""provokasi"" and ""mengusik"" depends on the specific nuance desired. ""Provokasi"" implies a deliberate attempt to incite a reaction, while ""mengusik"" suggests a more casual disturbance.

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good, straightforward translation.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (staining our honor) is accurate, but it's a bit formal. A more natural phrasing could be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang reputasi kami"" (He is very upset when people attack our reputation) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang merendahkan kami"" (He is very upset when people belittle us).

The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned.

The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, but it sounds a bit formal and less impactful than the original.

""Mencemarkan nama baik kita"" is a standard translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit stiff.

Here's a breakdown of problematic phrases and suggestions:

The source text conveys a sense of resentment and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat formal but also emotionally charged, particularly in the phrase ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and direct, using relatively simple language. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Quick"" in this context refers to one's wits, sensitivity, or vulnerability; it's a figurative expression. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a direct and damaging attack on their reputation and character.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong. While it conveys the meaning, it might be more natural to say ""penipu"" (swindler) or ""orang yang suka menipu"" (someone who likes to deceive) depending on the desired level of formality. ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a little awkward. A more natural phrasing could be ""Tolliver pasti lebih tidak suka.""

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku."" - ""Kesadaran"" (consciousness) is not the best translation for ""quick"" here. ""Kesadaran"" implies a higher level of awareness than intended. ""Diri sendiri"" is a bit redundant; simply ""diriku"" is sufficient. A better translation would be ""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kepekaan/sensitivitasku.""

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good translation and accurately conveys the meaning.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita."" - ""Mencemarkan nama baik"" (to tarnish someone's reputation) is a suitable translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it lacks the forceful and direct nature of the original. ""Mencemarkan"" is a bit milder than ""impugn."" A more impactful translation would be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang kehormatan kita"" (He is very upset when people attack our honor) or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang merendahkan kita"" (He is very upset when people belittle us).

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of anger and resentment. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or quick wit. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to manipulate or exploit them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone compared to the original.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong and doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""confidence trickster,"" which implies a more subtle form of manipulation. ""Bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" is a bit redundant; ""bahkan lebih tidak suka"" would be more natural.

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku."" - ""Kesadaran"" (consciousness) is not the best translation for ""quick"" in this context. ""Quick"" here refers to someone's wit, intelligence, or ability to respond quickly and cleverly. A better translation would be something like ""kecerdasanku"" (my quick wit) or ""reaksimu"" (your reaction/quickness).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kita."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kita"" (to stain our honor) is a literal translation of ""impugn our honor"" but lacks the forcefulness of the original. A more appropriate translation would be ""menuduh kita tidak jujur"" (to accuse us of dishonesty) or ""meragukan integritas kita"" (to doubt our integrity).

--- VERDICT ---

The translation needs revision. The phrasing in several places is too literal and lacks the subtle impact of the original. Specifically:

Replace ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" with ""bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya"" (even less likes it).
2.  **""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku.""** Change ""kesadaranku"" to ""kecerdasanku"" or ""reaksimu"".
3.  **""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kita.""** Change ""mencoreng kehormatan kita"" to ""menuduh kita tidak jujur"" or ""meragukan integritas kita"".

""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or quick wit. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to manipulate or exploit them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone compared to the original.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""Penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit strong and doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""confidence trickster,"" which implies a more subtle form of manipulation. ""Bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" is a bit redundant; ""bahkan lebih tidak suka"" would be more natural.

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku."" - ""Kesadaran"" (consciousness) is not the best translation for ""quick"" in this context. ""Quick"" here refers to someone's wit, intelligence, or ability to respond quickly and cleverly. A better translation would be something like ""kecerdasanku"" (my quick wit) or ""reaksimu"" (your reaction/quickness).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kita."" - ""Mencoreng kehormatan kita"" (to stain our honor) is a literal translation of ""impugn our honor"" but lacks the forcefulness of the original. A more appropriate translation would be ""menuduh kita tidak jujur"" (to accuse us of dishonesty) or ""meragukan integritas kita"" (to doubt our integrity).

needs_revision

The translation needs revision. The phrasing in several places is too literal and lacks the subtle impact of the original. Specifically:

1.  **""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi.""** Change ""penipu ulung"" to ""orang yang mencoba memanfaatkan kecerdasanku"" (someone who tries to exploit my wit) or ""orang yang mencoba mengelabui aku"" (someone who tries to deceive me). Replace ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" with ""bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya"" (even less likes it).
2.  **""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku.""** Change ""kesadaranku"" to ""kecerdasanku"" or ""reaksimu"".
3.  **""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kita.""** Change ""mencoreng kehormatan kita"" to ""menuduh kita tidak jujur"" or ""meragukan integritas kita"". This maintains the sense of a direct attack on reputation without being overly literal.

The suggested changes aim to maintain the original meaning while adopting a more idiomatic Indonesian phrasing that reflects the informal and slightly sarcastic tone of the source text.

","--- ORIGINAL CRITIQUE (The Requirements) ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""confidence trickster"" and ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple sentence structures. The meaning revolves around the speaker feeling unfairly targeted and having their integrity questioned. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or quick wit. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a direct attack on their reputation and character.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""penipu ulung"" is a literal translation of ""confidence trickster"" and sounds a bit formal and less impactful in Indonesian. While accurate, it doesn't capture the slightly sarcastic or dismissive tone of the original. ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" is grammatically correct but a bit verbose. A more natural phrasing would be ""bahkan Tolliver lebih tidak suka.""

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri saya sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh inti dari diri saya."" - ""menyentuh inti dari diri saya"" is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't convey the intended meaning. ""Touch my quick"" in this context refers to exploiting someone's vulnerabilities or quick wit. A better translation would be something like ""tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kecerdasan saya"" or ""tidak membiarkan mereka mengeksploitasi kelemahan saya.""

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This part is relatively well translated.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" is a literal translation of ""impugn our honor."" While understandable, it's a bit formal. A more natural and impactful translation would be ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kami"" or ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang merendahkan kami.""

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural flow of thought and agreement. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the dream.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" implies being far from people, which isn't the intended meaning of ""off the beaten road"" in this context.
2.  **""ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya""**: This is a very literal and clunky translation of ""inconveniences of a real log cabin."" It's grammatically correct but doesn't flow well. A more natural phrasing would be ""kekurangan kabin kayu yang asli"" (the drawbacks of a real log cabin) or ""masalah yang biasanya ada pada kabin kayu"" (the problems usually found in log cabins).
3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is a literal translation of ""right off of it."" While understandable, it's not the most idiomatic way to express this in Indonesian. ""Berdekatan dengan"" (close to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to) would be more natural.
4.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The phrase ""Di bagian belakang"" (At the back) and ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur"" (There's a terrace on the right side of the kitchen) are grammatically correct, but the repetition of ""di"" makes the text sound monotonous. Consider rephrasing some sentences to avoid this repetition.
5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and sounds unnatural. It should be omitted or replaced with a more natural expression of emphasis, such as ""perhatikan"" (notice) or simply implied through the context.
6.  **""Untuk steak""**: This is a literal translation of ""For steaks."" It's grammatically correct, but it sounds a bit awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (To grill steaks) or ""Agar bisa membuat steak.""

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" implies being far from people, not necessarily from roads or populated areas.
2.  **""ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya""**: This is a very literal translation and clunky in Indonesian. It would be more natural to say ""tanpa kekurangan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya"" (without the actual drawbacks of a log cabin) or ""tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada kabin kayu"" (without the usual problems with log cabins).
3.  **""di sampingnya""**: This is a common phrase, but it's a bit repetitive. ""tepat di sampingnya"" is redundant. ""Berdekatan dengan"" (close to) would be a more elegant alternative.
4.  **""Di bagian belakang""**: This is grammatically correct, but less natural than ""Di belakang rumah"" (at the back of the house).
5.  **""lihat?""**: This is a direct translation of ""see?"" and while understandable, it's a bit too informal and doesn't quite capture the conversational tone. A more natural phrasing would be ""Bagaimana?"" (How about?) or simply omitting it altogether.
6.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The frequent use of ""di"" (at/in) makes the sentences sound slightly monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur,"" consider ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur.""

""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.

""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku bicarakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti kabin kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""

""Tentu saja,"" katanya sambil meneguk bir.

Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, dengan ruang keluarga. Akan ada dapur di sana, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya. Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat?

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, focusing on details of the house's features. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its various amenities. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" implies being far from people, not necessarily from roads or populated areas.
2.  **""ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya""**: This is a very literal translation and clunky in Indonesian. It would be more natural to say ""tanpa kekurangan kabin kayu yang sebenarnya"" (without the actual drawbacks of a log cabin) or ""tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada kabin kayu"" (without the usual problems with log cabins).
3.  **""di sampingnya""**: This is a common phrase, but it's a bit repetitive. ""tepat di sampingnya"" is redundant. ""Berdekatan dengan"" (close to) would be a more elegant alternative.
4.  **""Di bagian belakang""**: This is grammatically correct, but less natural than ""Di belakang rumah"" (at the back of the house).
5.  **""lihat?""**: This is a direct translation of ""see?"" and while understandable, it's a bit too informal and doesn't quite capture the conversational tone. A more natural phrasing would be ""Bagaimana?"" (How about?) or simply omitting it altogether.
6.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The frequent use of ""di"" (at/in) makes the sentences sound slightly monotonous. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur,"" consider ""Teras berada di sisi kanan dapur.""

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision. The issues with unnatural phrasing and repetitive sentence structure detract from the overall quality. The translator needs to focus on conveying the meaning in a more idiomatic and natural way, paying attention to sentence flow and avoiding overly literal translations. Specific attention should be paid to replacing overly literal translations with more natural Indonesian expressions.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Off the beaten road"" implies a location that is secluded and perhaps a bit remote, not just far from a crowd. A better translation would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a secluded place) or ""di lokasi yang agak tersembunyi"" (in a somewhat hidden location).

2.  **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a very literal translation and sounds awkward in Indonesian. ""Inconveniences"" could be better conveyed as ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings) or ""masalah"" (problems). The phrase ""pondok kayu sungguhan"" (real log cabin) is redundant; simply ""pondok kayu"" (log cabin) is sufficient. A more natural phrasing would be ""tetapi tanpa kekurangan pondok kayu"" (but without the shortcomings of a log cabin) or ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (but without the problems usually found in log cabins).

3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""Di sampingnya"" is fine, but ""tepat di sampingnya"" is overly precise. ""Tepat di sebelah"" (right next to) would be more natural.

4.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The phrase ""Di bagian belakang, ada..."" and ""Di sisi kanan dapur, ada..."" becomes repetitive. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere*..."", consider ""Sebuah *porte cochere* akan ada di bagian belakang..."" (A *porte cochere* will be at the back...).

5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence.

","--- ORIGINAL CRITIQUE (The Requirements) ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, focusing on details of the house's features. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its various amenities. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its natural flow and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Off the beaten road"" implies a location that is secluded and perhaps a bit remote, not just far from a crowd. A better translation would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a secluded place) or ""di lokasi yang agak tersembunyi"" (in a somewhat hidden location).

2.  **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan""**: This is a very literal translation and sounds awkward in Indonesian. ""Inconveniences"" could be better conveyed as ""kekurangan"" (shortcomings) or ""masalah"" (problems). The phrase ""pondok kayu sungguhan"" (real log cabin) is redundant; simply ""pondok kayu"" (log cabin) is sufficient. A more natural phrasing would be ""tetapi tanpa kekurangan pondok kayu"" (but without the shortcomings of a log cabin) or ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada pondok kayu"" (but without the problems usually found in log cabins).

3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""Di sampingnya"" is fine, but ""tepat di sampingnya"" is overly precise. ""Tepat di sebelah"" (right next to) would be more natural.

4.  **Repetitive use of ""di""**: The phrase ""Di bagian belakang, ada..."" and ""Di sisi kanan dapur, ada..."" becomes repetitive. Varying the sentence structure would improve the flow. For example, instead of ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere*..."", consider ""Sebuah *porte cochere* akan ada di bagian belakang..."" (A *porte cochere* will be at the back...).

5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too informal and doesn't fit the overall tone. It's better to omit it or rephrase the sentence. For example, ""Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga. Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras untuk memanggang steak.""

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The issues primarily lie in awkward phrasing and overly literal translations that detract from the natural flow and tone of the original text. The translator needs to focus on conveying the meaning in a more idiomatic and less word-for-word manner, paying attention to sentence structure and avoiding unnecessary repetition. Specific attention should be paid to replacing literal translations with more natural Indonesian expressions.

The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and unnatural sentence structure in Indonesian. While the core meaning is preserved, the translation doesn't quite capture the natural flow and conversational tone of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and remoteness, not just distance from crowds. A better translation might be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place) or ""di lokasi yang sepi"" (in a quiet location).
2. ""pondok kayu sungguhan"" - The repetition of ""kayu"" (wood) feels redundant. ""pondok kayu"" is sufficient.
3. ""gambaran desainnya"" - This is a bit clunky. ""rencana desain"" (design plan) or ""gambar desain"" (design drawing) would be more natural.
4. ""tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal. ""berdekatan dengan"" (close to) or ""di sebelah"" (next to) would be more natural.
5. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit wordy. ""Di sana ada perapian"" (There is a fireplace there) or ""Perapian akan berada di sana"" (The fireplace will be there) would be better.
6. ""Untuk steak"" - This is a direct translation and works, but could be slightly improved with a more natural phrasing like ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (To grill steaks) or ""Agar bisa membuat steak.""

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and unnatural sentence structure in Indonesian. While the core meaning is conveyed, the translation doesn't quite capture the conversational flow and naturalness of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and perhaps a slightly remote location. ""jauh dari keramaian"" simply means ""far from the crowd"" and lacks that nuance. A better option might be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).

2. ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" - The phrase ""real log cabin"" is a bit redundant in English. The Indonesian translation repeats this redundancy, making it sound clunky. ""pondok kayu asli"" (original log cabin) or ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the real log cabin) would be better.

3. ""di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal and less natural than other options. ""tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" would be more natural.

4. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" - This sentence is overly verbose and slightly awkward. It could be restructured for better flow. Consider: ""Di bagian belakang rumah, ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (At the back of the house, there's a porte cochere for the car, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)

5. ""lihat?"" - This is a direct translation of ""see?"" and while understandable, it's a bit too literal and doesn't quite fit the conversational tone. It could be omitted entirely or replaced with a more natural phrase like ""kan?"" (right?) or simply left out.

6. ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Dan kamu bisa memasang pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can install a gas grill on the deck. For grilling steaks.)

""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.

""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku bicarakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet dan membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""

""Tentu,"" jawabnya, sambil meneguk bir.

Rumah itu akan memiliki dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, dengan ruang keluarga. Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya. Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat?

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The repetition of ""of course"" emphasizes the narrator's preferences and desires.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and unnatural sentence structure in Indonesian. While the core meaning is conveyed, the translation doesn't quite capture the conversational flow and naturalness of the original.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and perhaps a slightly remote location. ""jauh dari keramaian"" simply means ""far from the crowd"" and lacks that nuance. A better option might be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).

2. ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" - The phrase ""real log cabin"" is a bit redundant in English. The Indonesian translation repeats this redundancy, making it sound clunky. ""pondok kayu asli"" (original log cabin) or ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the real log cabin) would be better.

3. ""di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit formal and less natural than other options. ""tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" would be more natural.

4. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" - This sentence is overly verbose and slightly awkward. It could be restructured for better flow. Consider: ""Di bagian belakang rumah, ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (At the back of the house, there's a porte cochere for the car, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)

5. ""lihat?"" - This is a direct translation of ""see?"" and while understandable, it's a bit too literal and doesn't quite fit the conversational tone. It could be omitted entirely or replaced with a more natural phrase like ""kan?"" (right?) or simply left out.

6. ""Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak."" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be: ""Dan kamu bisa memasang pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk memanggang steak."" (And you can install a gas grill on the deck. For grilling steaks.)

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision
The translation needs revision to improve the natural flow and conversational tone. The issues primarily stem from overly literal translations and awkward phrasing. Focus on using more idiomatic Indonesian expressions and restructuring sentences to better reflect the original's casual style. Specifically, address the redundancy, clunkiness, and overly formal language in the identified phrases.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language. The meaning is clear and easy to understand. The narrator is describing their vision for a house, focusing on practical details and personal preferences. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""without the inconveniences"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The inclusion of the French term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of sophistication and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di luar jalur umum.""** - ""Of course, the house must be off the beaten road."" While grammatically correct, ""harus"" (must) feels a bit too formal and forceful. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian"" (Of course, the house should be far from the crowds) or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus terletak di tempat yang sepi"" (Of course, the house should be located in a quiet place). The original implies a desire for seclusion, which is not fully captured.

2.  **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya.""** - ""I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin."" This translation is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" is wordy and doesn't flow well. A better option would be ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kekurangan pondok kayu biasa"" (I want it to look like a log cabin, but without all the drawbacks of a regular log cabin) or ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa masalah-masalah yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu.""

3.  **""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya.""** - ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" The phrase ""tepat di sampingnya"" (right beside it) is redundant. It's implied that the bathroom is adjacent to the kitchen. A more concise translation would be ""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi bersebelahan."" (There'd be a kitchen here, with the bathroom next to it.)

4.  **""*Porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""** - The use of the foreign word *porte cochere* is good, but the explanation is a bit awkward. ""Jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" is grammatically correct but not elegant. A better phrasing would be ""Ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (There's a *porte cochere* for cars, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)

5.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan kompor gas di teras. Untuk steak.""** - The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" (And you can) is monotonous. It could be rephrased for better flow. For example: ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan teras bisa digunakan untuk menyimpan kayu bakar dan meletakkan kompor gas. Tentu saja, untuk steak."" (There's where the fireplace will be, and the deck can be used to store firewood and place a gas stove. Of course, for steak.)

--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language. The meaning is clear and easy to understand. The narrator is describing their vision for a house, focusing on practical details and personal preferences. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""without the inconveniences"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The inclusion of the French term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of sophistication and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di luar jalur umum.""** - ""Of course, the house must be off the beaten road."" While grammatically correct, ""harus"" (must) feels a bit too formal and forceful. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian"" (Of course, the house should be far from the crowds) or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus terletak di tempat yang sepi"" (Of course, the house should be located in a quiet place). The original implies a desire for seclusion, which is not fully captured.

2.  **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya.""** - ""I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin."" This translation is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" is wordy and doesn't flow well. A better option would be ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kekurangan pondok kayu biasa"" (I want it to look like a log cabin, but without all the drawbacks of a regular log cabin) or ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa masalah-masalah yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu.""

3.  **""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya.""** - ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" The phrase ""tepat di sampingnya"" (right beside it) is redundant. It's implied that the bathroom is adjacent to the kitchen. A more concise translation would be ""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi bersebelahan."" (There'd be a kitchen here, with the bathroom next to it.)

4.  **""*Porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""** - The use of the foreign word *porte cochere* is good, but the explanation is a bit awkward. ""Jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" is grammatically correct but not elegant. A better phrasing would be ""Ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (There's a *porte cochere* for cars, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)

5.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan kompor gas di teras. Untuk steak.""** - The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" (And you can) is monotonous. It could be rephrased for better flow. For example: ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan teras bisa digunakan untuk menyimpan kayu bakar dan meletakkan kompor gas. Tentu saja, untuk steak.""

""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis, sambil tersenyum.

""Oke,"" ujarku, pelan-pelan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin rumahnya terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kekurangan pondok kayu biasa. Aku menemukan gambarnya di internet, lalu membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""

""Tentu saja,"" katanya, sambil mengicipi bir.

Rumahnya akan memiliki dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga. Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat bersebelahan. Aku menunduk, menggambar di meja dengan jariku. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, tahu?

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and conversational. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language. The meaning is clear and easy to understand. The narrator is describing their vision for a house, focusing on practical details and personal preferences. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""without the inconveniences"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The inclusion of the French term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of sophistication and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di luar jalur umum.""** - ""Of course, the house must be off the beaten road."" While grammatically correct, ""harus"" (must) feels a bit too formal and forceful. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian"" (Of course, the house should be far from the crowds) or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus terletak di tempat yang sepi"" (Of course, the house should be located in a quiet place). The original implies a desire for seclusion, which is not fully captured.

2.  **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya.""** - ""I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin."" This translation is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" is wordy and doesn't flow well. A better option would be ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kekurangan pondok kayu biasa"" (I want it to look like a log cabin, but without all the drawbacks of a regular log cabin) or ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa masalah-masalah yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu.""

3.  **""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya.""** - ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" The phrase ""tepat di sampingnya"" (right beside it) is redundant. It's implied that the bathroom is adjacent to the kitchen. A more concise translation would be ""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi bersebelahan."" (There'd be a kitchen here, with the bathroom next to it.)

4.  **""*Porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""** - The use of the foreign word *porte cochere* is good, but the explanation is a bit awkward. ""Jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" is grammatically correct but not elegant. A better phrasing would be ""Ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, sehingga kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (There's a *porte cochere* for cars, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)

5.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan kompor gas di teras. Untuk steak.""** - The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" (And you can) is monotonous. It could be rephrased for better flow. For example: ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan teras bisa digunakan untuk menyimpan kayu bakar dan meletakkan kompor gas. Tentu saja, untuk steak."" (There's where the fireplace will be, and the deck can be used to store firewood and place a gas stove. Of course, for steak.)

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the tone and style of the original.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, this is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" sounds a bit like a formal statement rather than a casual preference.
2. ""pondok kayu"" - This is a direct translation of ""log cabin"" and is acceptable, but it lacks the charm of the original. Consider ""rumah bergaya pondok kayu"" (log cabin-style house) or ""rumah kayu sederhana"" (simple wooden house).
3. ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" - This is a bit clunky. ""Kekurangannya dibandingkan pondok kayu asli"" (its disadvantages compared to a real log cabin) would be smoother.
4. ""di sebelahnya"" - This is grammatically correct but a bit bland. ""tepat di sampingnya"" (right next to it) or ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) would be more natural.
5. ""lihat?"" - This is a direct translation of ""see?"" and is acceptable, but it can be replaced with a more natural Indonesian expression like ""bukan?"" (right?) or simply omitted.
6. ""di sisi ruang keluarga"" - This is a bit awkward. ""di sisi lain dari ruang keluarga"" (on the other side of the living room) would be more natural.
7. ""bukan basah kuyup"" - This is a bit redundant. ""agar tidak basah"" (so it doesn't get wet) is more concise.
8. The use of ""*porte cochere*"" is good, but it should be followed by a brief explanation or context if the target audience is not familiar with the term. Otherwise, it might sound out of place.

The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language to paint a picture of the dream house. The meaning is clear and easy to follow, detailing the features of the house and the narrator's preferences. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""without the inconveniences"" adds to the descriptive and slightly whimsical tone. The inclusion of the French term ""*porte cochere*"" adds a touch of sophistication and detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main points of the original text. However, there are several areas where the translation could be improved to better match the tone and style of the original.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, this is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" sounds a bit like a formal statement rather than a casual preference.
2. ""pondok kayu"" - This is a direct translation of ""log cabin"" and is acceptable, but it lacks the charm of the original. Consider ""rumah bergaya pondok kayu"" (log cabin-style house) or ""rumah kayu sederhana"" (simple wooden house).
3. ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" - This is a bit clunky. ""Kekurangannya dibandingkan pondok kayu asli"" (its disadvantages compared to a real log cabin) would be smoother.
4. ""di sebelahnya"" - This is grammatically correct but a bit bland. ""tepat di sampingnya"" (right next to it) or ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) would be more natural.
5. ""lihat?"" - This is a direct translation of ""see?"" and is acceptable, but it can be replaced with a more natural Indonesian expression like ""bukan?"" (right?) or simply omitted.
6. ""di sisi ruang keluarga"" - This is a bit awkward. ""di sisi lain dari ruang keluarga"" (on the other side of the living room) would be more natural.
7. ""bukan basah kuyup"" - This is a bit redundant. ""agar tidak basah"" (so it doesn't get wet) is more concise.
8. The use of ""*porte cochere*"" is good, but it should be followed by a brief explanation or context if the target audience is not familiar with the term. Otherwise, it might sound out of place.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision. The overall meaning is conveyed, but the phrasing is often too formal or clunky, and lacks the natural flow of conversation. Specific improvements are suggested above for each problematic phrase. The translation should aim for a more conversational and descriptive style, mirroring the original's tone.

""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.

""Baiklah,"" ujarku, pelan-pelan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku ceritakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari hiruk pikuk kota. Aku ingin gayanya seperti rumah kayu, tapi tanpa semua ketidaknyamanannya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""

""Tentu saja,"" katanya sambil mengicipi birnya.

""Di belakang rumah, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Di sisi kanan dapur, ada teras, kan? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di sisi ruang keluarga. Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di sana.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of introspection as the speaker reveals details about their dream house. The style is straightforward and descriptive, using simple language to paint a picture of the house. The meaning is clear and easy to follow, detailing the speaker's vision for their ideal home. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and specificity. The inclusion of the French term ""*porte cochere*"" suggests a certain level of sophistication and attention to detail.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that detract from its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it doesn't capture the intended meaning of seclusion and tranquility. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di tempat yang tenang"" (in a quiet place).
2.  **""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya""**: The phrase ""pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" is grammatically correct but sounds awkward. ""Pondok kayu asli"" (original log cabin) or ""pondok kayu sungguhan"" (real log cabin) would be more natural.
3.  **""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya""**: This is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu"" is better.
4.  **""tepat di sebelahnya""**: This is a very literal translation of ""right off of it."" A more natural phrasing would be ""berdekatan dengan"" (adjacent to) or ""di sampingnya"" (next to it).
5.  **""menggambar dengan jariku""**: This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit unnatural. ""Menggambar dengan jari"" is acceptable, but ""menggambar dengan jari di meja"" (drawing with fingers on the table) would be more idiomatic.
6.  **""Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah kuyup""**: The use of ""Anda"" (you - formal) is inconsistent with the casual tone of the original. ""Kamu bisa membawa belanjaan..."" (You can bring groceries...) would be more appropriate. Also, ""tanpa basah kuyup"" is a bit dramatic. ""Tanpa kena hujan"" (without getting wet from the rain) or ""tanpa basah"" (without getting wet) would be more natural.
7.  **""lihat?""**: This is an unnecessary and somewhat awkward addition. It can be omitted without affecting the meaning.
8.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada""**: This is a bit formal. ""Di sanalah perapiannya"" is more natural.
9.  **""Untuk steak""**: This is a literal translation and sounds a bit abrupt. ""Untuk makan steak"" (for eating steak) or ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (for grilling steak) would be more natural.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di luar jalur umum.""** - ""Of course, the house must be off the beaten road."" While grammatically correct, ""harus"" (must) feels a bit too strong and formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu sebaiknya berada di luar jalur umum"" (Of course, the house should be off the beaten road) or ""Tentu saja, aku ingin rumah itu berada di luar jalur umum"" (Of course, I want the house to be off the beaten road).

2.  **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan.""** - ""I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin."" The phrasing is a bit clunky. ""Tampilannya seperti pondok kayu"" is correct, but ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" is not the most natural way to express ""inconveniences of a real log cabin."" A better translation would be ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kesulitan yang ada pada pondok kayu sungguhan"" (I want it to look like a log cabin, but without all the difficulties that come with a real log cabin).

3.  **""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya.""** - ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" This is grammatically correct, but the phrasing is a bit stiff. ""Tepat di sebelahnya"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Ada dapur di sini, dan kamar mandi persis di sampingnya"" (There's a kitchen here, and the bathroom right next to it) or ""Ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan.""

4.  **""*Porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""** - The use of the loanword ""*porte cochere*"" is appropriate, but the sentence structure is awkward. ""Jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" is a bit wordy. A more natural phrasing would be ""*Porte cochere* untuk mobil, supaya kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (A *porte cochere* for cars, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)

5.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan kompor gas di teras. Untuk steak.""** - The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" (And you can) is redundant and makes the sentence feel less fluid. It should be rephrased to avoid this repetition. For example: ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Di teras juga bisa kamu meletakkan kompor gas untuk memanggang steak."" (The fireplace will be there, and you can store firewood on the deck. You can also place a gas grill on the deck for grilling steaks.)

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds a touch of personality and aspiration.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di luar jalur umum.""** - ""Of course, the house must be off the beaten road."" While grammatically correct, ""harus"" (must) feels a bit too strong and formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu sebaiknya berada di luar jalur umum"" (Of course, the house should be off the beaten road) or ""Tentu saja, aku ingin rumah itu berada di luar jalur umum"" (Of course, I want the house to be off the beaten road).

2.  **""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan.""** - ""I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin."" The phrasing is a bit clunky. ""Tampilannya seperti pondok kayu"" is correct, but ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" is not the most natural way to express ""inconveniences of a real log cabin."" A better translation would be ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua kesulitan yang ada pada pondok kayu sungguhan"" (I want it to look like a log cabin, but without all the difficulties that come with a real log cabin).

3.  **""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sebelahnya.""** - ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" This is grammatically correct, but the phrasing is a bit stiff. ""Tepat di sebelahnya"" is a bit formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""Ada dapur di sini, dan kamar mandi persis di sampingnya"" (There's a kitchen here, and the bathroom right next to it) or ""Ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi yang bersebelahan.""

4.  **""*Porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah.""** - The use of the loanword ""*porte cochere*"" is appropriate, but the sentence structure is awkward. ""Jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah"" is a bit wordy. A more natural phrasing would be ""*Porte cochere* untuk mobil, supaya kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa terkena hujan."" (A *porte cochere* for cars, so you can directly bring groceries to the kitchen without getting wet.)

5.  **""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan kompor gas di teras. Untuk steak.""** - The repetition of ""Dan kamu bisa"" (And you can) is redundant and makes the sentence feel less fluid. It should be rephrased to avoid this repetition. For example: ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Di teras juga bisa kamu meletakkan kompor gas untuk memanggang steak."" (The fireplace will be there, and you can store firewood on the deck. You can also place a gas grill on the deck for grilling steaks.)

The translation needs revision to improve its naturalness and flow. The issues primarily stem from overly formal phrasing and redundant sentence structures.

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of phrases like ""off the beaten road"" and ""the inconveniences of a real log cabin"" adds a touch of personality and humor. The repetition of ""Of course"" emphasizes the narrator's certainty and enthusiasm.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that affect its naturalness and stylistic consistency.

1. ""jauh dari keramaian"" - While accurate, ""off the beaten road"" implies a degree of seclusion and remoteness that ""jauh dari keramaian"" doesn't fully capture. It could be improved to ""di tempat yang terpencil"" (in a remote place) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location) to better convey the intended meaning.

2. ""pondok kayu"" - This is a literal translation of ""log cabin"" and doesn't quite capture the specific aesthetic the narrator is aiming for. ""Rumah bergaya pondok kayu"" (log cabin style house) would be more appropriate.

3. ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan"" - This is a bit clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan"" is a bit formal. A better phrasing would be ""kekurangan rumah pondok kayu biasa"" (the drawbacks of a typical log cabin) or ""masalah-masalah yang sering terjadi pada rumah pondok kayu"" (the problems often encountered with log cabins).

4. ""menyesap bir"" - This is a good translation, but it's a bit formal. ""Minum bir"" (drink beer) would be more natural in this context.

5. ""tepat di sampingnya"" - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. ""Tepat di sebelah"" or ""berdekatan dengan"" would be more natural.

6. ""lihat?"" - This is an informal interjection that is difficult to translate directly. It's used to seek confirmation or emphasize a point.  It could be omitted entirely or replaced with a more natural phrase like ""bisa bayangkan?"" (can you imagine?) or simply left implied.

7. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada"" - This is a bit awkward. ""Di sanalah perapian akan ditempatkan"" or ""Perapian akan berada di sana"" would flow better.

8. ""Untuk steak"" - This is a literal translation and sounds unnatural. ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (to grill steak) or ""Agar bisa membuat steak"" (so you can make steak) would be more idiomatic.
