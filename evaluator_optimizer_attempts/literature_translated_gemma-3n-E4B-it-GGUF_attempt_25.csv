Alternatives include ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!*"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid!) or ""*Nggak mungkin bunuh diri!*"" (No way he committed suicide!) to better capture the sarcastic tone.
*   ""wild girlfriend"" is translated as ""pacar bebasnya."" While accurate, it lacks the colorfulness of the original. Consider ""*pacar sesuka hati*"" (girlfriend as she pleases) or ""*pacar yang lepas kendali*"" (uncontrolled girlfriend).
*   ""intent face"" translated as ""wajah serius"". While accurate, consider ""wajah tegang"" (tense face) or ""ekspresi serius"" (serious expression) for a slightly more natural flow.
*   The use of ""dalam hati, dan tanpa suara"" is somewhat redundant. The initial ""dalam hati"" implies ""silent,"" so it might be unnecessary.

    <item>Novel synopsis: The narrator, Harper Connelly, has what you might call a strange job: she finds dead people. She can sense the final location of a person who's passed, and share their very last moment. The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent - even if the dead can wait forever.</item>
    <item>Previous paragraph: WE had a dismal time at the police station. The state police thought I was a blood-sucking leech. I'd anticipated their attitude as we drove into town, but it wore me out anyway. The male faces followed each other in slow succession.

<feedback><analysis>The source text expresses frustration at being perceived negatively, specifically as a ""confidence trickster"" and the associated feeling of having one's integrity questioned. The tone is defensive and somewhat resentful. The phrase ""don't let them touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning ""don't pry into my thoughts or feelings"" or ""don't get personally involved."" Tolliver's reaction to people questioning their honor reinforces the idea that they are viewed with suspicion. The cultural nuance is that the perceived offense is related to their profession and how it's viewed by others.</analysis>
<evaluation>The translation is mostly accurate but contains some awkward phrasings and misses the nuance of ""don't let them touch my quick.""

*   For ""impugn our honor"": ""Mereka mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (They tarnish our honor) - more direct and impactful. Or ""Mereka merendahkan kehormatan kami"" (They belittle our honor).

I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangan di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""

""Tentu,"" jawabnya, sambil mengquisir bir.",evaluator,N/A,fail,"<analysis>The source text presents a casual conversation between two characters, Hollis and the narrator. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of introspection from the narrator. The language is straightforward and accessible. The key nuance is the narrator's somewhat unusual profession juxtaposed with a seemingly ordinary conversation about a dream house, highlighting the contrast in her life. The use of ""of course"" indicates a certain expectation or established pattern in the conversation.</analysis>
<evaluation>The Indonesian translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, the phrasing ""jauh dari jalan utama"" (far from the main road) is a bit literal and could be more idiomatic. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama"" sounds slightly stiff. A more natural phrasing might be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang terpencil"" (Of course, the house must be in a remote place) or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus terletak di pinggiran kota/di daerah yang sepi"" (Of course, the house must be located in the suburbs/in a quiet area). The verb ""mengquisir"" (to sip/guzzle) is a little too informal for the context and might be replaced with ""meminum"" (to drink) which is more neutral. While the translation is understandable, it lacks a certain fluidity and naturalness. The repetition of ""Tentu"" (Of course) could also be smoothed out. Consider rephrasing the dialogue to avoid such repetition. </evaluation>

    <item>Novel synopsis: The narrator, Harper Connelly, has what you might call a strange job: she finds dead people. She can sense the final location of a person who's passed, and share their very last moment. The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent - even if the dead can wait forever.</item>

<feedback><analysis>The source text presents a casual conversation between two characters, Hollis and the narrator. The tone is relaxed and conversational, with a hint of introspection from the narrator. The language is straightforward and accessible. The key nuance is the narrator's somewhat unusual profession juxtaposed with a seemingly ordinary conversation about a dream house, highlighting the contrast in her life. The use of ""of course"" indicates a certain expectation or established pattern in the conversation.</analysis>
<evaluation>The Indonesian translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, the phrasing ""jauh dari jalan utama"" (far from the main road) is a bit literal and could be more idiomatic. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari jalan utama"" sounds slightly stiff. A more natural phrasing might be ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di tempat yang terpencil"" (Of course, the house must be in a remote place) or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus terletak di pinggiran kota/di daerah yang sepi"" (Of course, the house must be located in the suburbs/in a quiet area). The verb ""mengquisir"" (to sip/guzzle) is a little too informal for the context and might be replaced with ""meminum"" (to drink) which is more neutral. While the translation is understandable, it lacks a certain fluidity and naturalness. The repetition of ""Tentu"" (Of course) could also be smoothed out. Consider rephrasing the dialogue to avoid such repetition. </evaluation>

The tone is conversational and informal, reflecting a casual discussion. The use of ""porte cochere"" introduces a slightly elevated, perhaps slightly old-fashioned, element to the description. The speaker is outlining features and benefits in a relaxed manner, creating a sense of practicality and comfort. The context of the novel suggests Harper is describing a property she is assessing for a client, so the detail is important. The Indonesian translation attempts to maintain this conversational tone, but the rendering of ""porte cochere"" requires careful consideration.</analysis>
<evaluation>The Indonesian translation is mostly accurate, but the rendering of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""*porte cochere*"" is problematic. As noted in the external knowledge, this term isn't commonly used in Indonesian. The translation should either use a more common Indonesian equivalent (e.g., ""carport"" or a descriptive phrase like ""tempat parkir mobil yang tertutup"") or explain the function if a direct translation is deemed necessary. The rest of the translation is quite natural and maintains the informal tone of the original. The use of ""di sana"" (there) is a bit repetitive and could be varied for stylistic improvement.

<feedback><analysis>The source text describes a house layout and features. The tone is conversational and informal, reflecting a casual discussion. The use of ""porte cochere"" introduces a slightly elevated, perhaps slightly old-fashioned, element to the description. The speaker is outlining features and benefits in a relaxed manner, creating a sense of practicality and comfort. The context of the novel suggests Harper is describing a property she is assessing for a client, so the detail is important. The Indonesian translation attempts to maintain this conversational tone, but the rendering of ""porte cochere"" requires careful consideration.</analysis>
<evaluation>The Indonesian translation is mostly accurate, but the rendering of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""*porte cochere*"" is problematic. As noted in the external knowledge, this term isn't commonly used in Indonesian. The translation should either use a more common Indonesian equivalent (e.g., ""carport"" or a descriptive phrase like ""tempat parkir mobil yang tertutup"") or explain the function if a direct translation is deemed necessary. The rest of the translation is quite natural and maintains the informal tone of the original. The use of ""di sana"" (there) is a bit repetitive and could be varied for stylistic improvement. For example, instead of ""Akan ada dapur di sana,"" consider ""Akan ada dapur di sana."" or ""Ada dapur di sana.""</evaluation>

The tone is conversational and informal, reflecting a casual discussion. The use of descriptive details aims to paint a picture for the listener/reader.

<evaluation>The translation is mostly accurate in conveying the information about the house layout. However, the translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""entrada mobil"" is not ideal. While understandable, it lacks the elegance and specific meaning of the original. ""Porte cochere"" implies a covered driveway or portico, offering shelter while allowing passengers to disembark. A more natural and accurate translation could be ""area parkir tertutup"" (covered parking area) or ""carport"" depending on the desired level of formality. The sentence structure is generally acceptable, but could benefit from minor adjustments for better flow and naturalness in Indonesian. For example, ""Dapur akan terhubung langsung dengan kamar mandi. Lalu, akan ada sebuah area *entrada mobil* yang tertutup..."" could be rephrased to ""Ada dapur yang terhubung langsung dengan kamar mandi, dan juga area parkir tertutup...""</evaluation>
