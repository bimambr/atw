The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone. The phrase ""Suicide, my ass"" is a strong, dismissive expression. The style is direct and conversational, using contractions (""hadn't"") and a relatively simple sentence structure. The meaning is clear: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that the deceased committed suicide. The text also establishes a sense of mystery and a slightly detached, observant narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and informality of the original. The phrase ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" is a literal translation and feels somewhat stiff and less impactful than ""Suicide, my ass."" While ""omong kosong"" means nonsense, it doesn't quite capture the dismissive, almost vulgar tone of the original. The sentence structure is also a bit clunky in places. ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but lacks the natural flow of the English. The use of ""mengunjungi makamnya"" (visit his grave) is a bit formal; a more natural phrasing might be ""pergi ke makamnya"" (go to his grave). ""Wajah serius seorang wakil"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy"" and doesn't convey the same sense of focused observation. ""Intant"" is not the right word to describe the face of a deputy.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

*   ""Suicide, my ass"" -> ""Bunuh diri? Omong kosong"" - Needs a more impactful and informal equivalent. Consider options like ""Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid!) or ""Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin!"" (Suicide? Impossible!).
*   ""Why hadn't Sybil hired me..."" -> ""Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya..."" - While grammatically correct, it's a bit formal. Consider ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya..."" (Why didn't Sybil employ me...).
*   ""intent face of the deputy"" -> ""wajah serius seorang wakil"" - This is a literal translation and doesn't capture the nuance. Consider ""wajah yang fokus dari seorang wakil"" (the focused face of a deputy) or ""wajah seorang wakil yang memperhatikan"" (the face of a deputy who is observing).

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characteristic of a detective character's internal monologue. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (""my ass,"" ""wild girlfriend""). The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is dismissing the possibility of suicide and stating that a murder has occurred. The style is concise and focuses on conveying information efficiently.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. ""Omong kosong"" is a valid Indonesian word for nonsense, but it doesn't carry the same level of contempt or disbelief as the English idiom. The sentence structure is also a bit clunky in places. For example, ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less impactful than the original. The use of ""terlebih dahulu"" (first) is a bit redundant. ""Makamnya"" (his grave) is correct, but could be more concise. ""Wajah serius wakil"" is a literal translation of ""intent face of the deputy"" and doesn't quite convey the intended meaning. ""Intent"" in this context implies a focused, determined, or even menacing look. ""Serius"" means serious, which is not the same.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases and potential improvements:

*   ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" could be improved to something like ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*"" (Suicide? Don't be stupid.) or ""*Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.*"" (Suicide? Impossible.) These options retain the dismissive tone while sounding more natural in Indonesian.
*   ""Mengapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" could be rephrased as ""*Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?*"" This is more concise and flows better.
*   ""Wajah serius wakil"" should be changed to something that conveys a more intense or focused look. Options include ""*Wajah tegang wakil*"" (tense face of the deputy) or ""*Ekspresi wakil yang serius*"" (the deputy's serious expression).
*   ""Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,"" kataku."" is fine, but could be slightly more emphatic: ""*Tidak mungkin bunuh diri di sini,* kataku."" (There's no way someone committed suicide here, I said.)

The source text employs a cynical and slightly informal tone, characterized by the use of slang (""my ass"") and contractions. The style is direct and conversational, reflecting the narrator's world-weariness and sharp wit. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption that a young man died by suicide and believes foul play is involved. The text establishes a mystery and hints at a larger, more complex situation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and nuance of the original. The phrase ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" is a literal translation of ""Suicide, my ass,"" which doesn't quite capture the dismissive and sarcastic tone. While ""Omong kosong"" means nonsense, it doesn't carry the same level of contempt or disbelief as the English idiom. The sentence ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" is grammatically correct but sounds somewhat clunky and formal in Indonesian. The phrasing is a bit too literal and doesn't flow as naturally as it could. ""Makamnya"" is correct, but could be improved. ""Pacar playboy-nya"" is a direct translation of ""wild girlfriend"" and is understandable, but it lacks the evocative quality of the original. ""Wild girlfriend"" implies a certain recklessness and untamed nature, which is lost in the more literal translation. ""Wajah serius wakil sheriff itu"" is a correct translation of ""intent face of the deputy,"" but ""serius"" is a bit bland. ""Intense"" or ""tegas"" might be better choices to convey the deputy's focused and serious demeanor.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases and suggestions:

1. ""*Bunuh diri? Omong kosong*"" - Consider alternatives that convey the same level of disbelief and sarcasm. Possible options: ""*Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh.*"" (Suicide? Don't be foolish.) or ""*Bunuh diri? Tidak mungkin.*"" (Suicide? Impossible.)
2. ""Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?"" - Rephrase for better flow: ""*Mengapa Sybil tidak meminta saya untuk memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan mencari Teenie?*"" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to check the grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to look for Teenie?) This is a more natural and concise way of expressing the same idea.
3. ""Pacar playboy-nya"" - Consider a more evocative phrase: ""*pacar yang hidupnya riuh*"" (a girlfriend whose life is chaotic) or ""*pacar yang suka berbuat onar*"" (a girlfriend who likes to cause trouble).
4. ""Wajah serius wakil sheriff itu"" - Consider: ""*Ekspresi tegas wakil sheriff itu*"" (The firm expression of the deputy) or ""*Wajah serius wakil sheriff itu*"" (The serious face of the deputy) is acceptable, but ""tegas"" is a stronger word.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of anger and resentment. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to provoke or upset someone deeply. The overall meaning is that the speaker is offended by being manipulated and is resistant to attempts to undermine their self-respect and reputation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but contains some awkward phrasing and misses nuances in the original text. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, but it sounds a bit clunky in Indonesian. While understandable, it doesn't capture the subtle implication of a calculated deception. ""Saraf sensitif saya"" (sensitive nerves) is a literal translation of ""quick"" and doesn't convey the intended meaning of a vulnerable emotional core. ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" (blemish our honor) is a valid translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and lacks the forceful impact of the original. The sentence structure is also slightly convoluted in places.

Here's a breakdown of specific problematic phrases:

* ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster"" -> ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" could be improved to ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" (I don't like being treated like someone who tries to deceive) or ""Saya tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu"" (I don't like being considered a trickster). The first option is more natural, while the second is more concise.
* ""touch my quick"" -> ""menyentuh saraf sensitif saya"" should be rephrased to something more idiomatic. Options include ""mengusik saya"" (to bother me), ""memprovokasi saya"" (to provoke me), or ""mengganggu saya secara emosional"" (to emotionally disturb me). The best choice depends on the specific context.
* ""impugn our honor"" -> ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" could be replaced with ""menuduh kami tidak jujur"" (accuse us of dishonesty) or ""meragukan integritas kami"" (doubt our integrity). These options are more direct and impactful.

* ""impugn our honor"" -> ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" could be replaced with ""menuduh kami tidak jujur"" (accuse us of dishonesty) or ""meragukan integritas kami"" (doubt our integrity). These options are more direct and impactful.

needs_revision
The translation needs revision. The current translation is understandable but lacks the nuance and impact of the original. The phrasing is often too literal and doesn't fully capture the intended meaning and tone. The suggested revisions aim to improve the naturalness and expressiveness of the Indonesian text while maintaining accuracy.

The source text conveys a sense of frustration and defensiveness. The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""confidence trickster"" and ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or cleverness. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a direct attack on their reputation and character.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural flow in Indonesian.

""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya."" - This is a fairly direct translation and acceptable, but ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) feels a bit strong. ""Penipu"" (swindler) might be more appropriate, depending on the context. ""Bahkan lebih membencinya"" (even more hates it) is grammatically correct but sounds a little clunky. A smoother alternative could be ""bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya"" (even less likes it).

""Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh akalku."" - ""Menyentuh akalku"" (touch my wit/mind) is a literal translation of ""touch my quick"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Akal"" can mean wit, intelligence, or even a clever plan. In this context, it implies exploiting someone's cleverness or vulnerabilities. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh kecerdasanku"" (touch my intelligence) or ""memanfaatkan kelicikanku"" (exploit my cleverness).

""Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil."" - This is a good, straightforward translation.

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencemarkan nama baik kami."" - This is also a good translation. ""Mencemarkan nama baik"" is a standard way to say ""to damage someone's reputation.""

Overall, the translation is understandable, but it lacks the nuance and natural flow of the original. The figurative language needs more careful consideration to ensure the Indonesian conveys the same feeling of vulnerability and defensiveness.

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of anger and resentment. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to manipulate or exploit them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and naturalness in certain areas. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, but it sounds a bit clunky and less impactful than the original. While ""penipu"" means ""trickster"" or ""swindler,"" ""ulung"" emphasizes skill or expertise in trickery, which isn't quite the same as the implied deliberate deception in the original. ""Inti saya"" is a literal translation of ""quick,"" which is a figurative term for vulnerabilities or sensitive points. It doesn't capture the figurative meaning effectively. ""Mencoreng nama baik kita"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and could be phrased more naturally. The repetition of ""dia"" (he) is also slightly awkward.

Here's a breakdown of specific phrases:

*   ""I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster"" -> ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung"" could be improved to ""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu."" (I don't like being treated like someone who tries to deceive.) This is more natural and conveys the intended meaning more clearly.
*   ""I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick"" -> ""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh inti saya."" could be improved to ""Saya menarik diri dan melindungi diri, tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kelemahan saya."" (I withdraw and protect myself, not letting them exploit my weaknesses.) This captures the figurative meaning of ""quick"" better.

The tone is somewhat informal and direct, using colloquialisms like ""quick"" (referring to nerves or sensitivity) and ""impugn our honor."" The style is straightforward and focuses on the internal emotional state of the speaker. The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and the discomfort of having one's vulnerabilities exploited. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a perception of being deceived or manipulated, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation and integrity.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly formal tone that doesn't quite capture the original's informal feel.

""Saya tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung, dan saya yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi."" - ""penipu ulung"" (master swindler) is a bit too strong. While accurate, it lacks the nuance of ""confidence trickster,"" which implies a more subtle form of deception or manipulation. ""bahkan lebih tidak suka lagi"" is grammatically correct but sounds overly formal. A more natural phrasing would be ""bahkan lebih tidak suka.""

""Saya menarik diri ke dalam diri sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh saraf saya."" - ""menyentuh saraf saya"" (touch my nerves) is a literal translation and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to nerves, sensitivity, or emotional core. A better translation would be something like ""menyentuh perasaan saya"" (touch my feelings) or ""mengganggu sensitivitas saya"" (disturb my sensitivity).

""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang mencemarkan nama baik kita."" - ""mencemarkan nama baik kita"" (defame our reputation) is accurate but a bit formal. ""Impugn our honor"" implies a more direct and personal attack on character. A more suitable translation could be ""ketika orang menyerang kehormatan kita"" (when people attack our honor) or ""ketika orang merendahkan kita"" (when people belittle us).

The source text conveys a sense of defensiveness and wounded pride. The tone is somewhat formal but also carries a hint of anger and resentment. The style is straightforward and uses relatively simple language, but the phrasing is deliberate and impactful. ""Confidence trickster"" implies a deliberate attempt to deceive, while ""impugn our honor"" suggests a direct attack on reputation. ""Touch my quick"" is a figurative expression meaning to exploit or take advantage of someone's vulnerabilities or cleverness. The overall meaning is that the speaker feels unfairly targeted and is resisting attempts to undermine them.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from some awkward phrasing and a slightly less impactful tone than the original. ""Penipu ulung"" translates ""confidence trickster"" literally, but it sounds a bit clunky in Indonesian. While understandable, it doesn't capture the nuance of the original. ""Keunggulan"" translates ""quick"" literally, which is not the intended meaning. ""Quick"" in this context refers to cleverness, wit, or a sharp mind – a vulnerability that someone might exploit. ""Mencoreng kehormatan kami"" is a good translation of ""impugn our honor,"" but it's a bit formal and could be made more natural. The sentence structure is mostly correct, but the flow isn't as smooth as it could be.

Here's a breakdown of specific issues:

1. ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung..."" - While accurate, consider alternatives. ""Aku tidak suka dianggap sebagai penipu ulung"" (I don't like being *considered* a confidence trickster) might sound more natural. Alternatively, ""Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu"" (I don't like being treated like someone who tries to deceive) could work.
2. ""...dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya."" - This is grammatically correct, but the repetition of ""tidak"" (not) feels a little heavy. Consider ""dan aku yakin Tolliver sangat tidak menyukainya juga"" (and I'm sure Tolliver also really dislikes it).
3. ""...dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh keunggulanku."" - ""Keunggulan"" is too literal. Consider ""dan tidak membiarkan mereka memanfaatkan kecerdasanku"" (and I don't let them exploit my cleverness) or ""dan tidak membiarkan mereka mengeksploitasi akal buldanku"" (and I don't let them exploit my wit). The best choice depends on the specific context and the speaker's personality.
4. ""Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami."" - This is a good translation, but ""mencoreng kehormatan kami"" is quite formal.

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see?

Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""

""Tentu,"" katanya sambil meneguk bir.

Rumah itu akan memiliki dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, dengan ruang keluarga. Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya. Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat?

The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

--- EVALUATION ---
The translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues that impact its natural flow and stylistic consistency.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location). ""Jauh dari keramaian"" implies being far from people, which isn't the intended meaning of ""off the beaten road"" in this context.
2.  **""ketidaknyamanan kabin kayu sungguhan""**: This is a very literal translation and sounds clunky. ""Ketidaknyamanan"" (inconveniences) is correct, but ""kabin kayu sungguhan"" (real log cabin) is redundant. A more natural phrasing would be ""tetapi tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada pada kabin kayu"" (but without the usual problems with log cabins) or ""tetapi tanpa kesulitan yang sering dihadapi dengan kabin kayu"" (but without the difficulties often faced with log cabins).
3.  **""tepat di sampingnya""**: This is grammatically correct but a bit formal. ""Di sebelah"" (next to) would be more natural.
4.  **""Di bagian belakang""**: This is correct, but could be slightly improved by using ""Di belakang rumah"" (at the back of the house) for clarity.
5.  **""lihat?""**: The use of ""lihat?"" (see?) is too literal and sounds awkward. It should be replaced with a more natural expression like ""kamu tahu"" (you know) or simply omitted.
6.  **Repetitive sentence structure**: The translation frequently uses similar sentence structures, making the text feel monotonous. Varying sentence length and structure would improve readability.
7.  **""Untuk steak""**: While technically correct, it sounds a bit abrupt. A more natural phrasing might be ""Untuk memanggang steak"" (to grill steak) or ""Untuk memasak steak"" (to cook steak).

The source text is a casual conversation between two people, Hollis and the narrator, about the narrator's dream house. The tone is relaxed and informal, using simple language and conversational phrasing. The style is descriptive, painting a picture of the dream house through details. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is describing their ideal home and its features. The use of ""of course"" indicates a natural, almost expected progression of thought. The inclusion of specific details like a *porte cochere* and a gas grill adds to the realism and personality of the narrator.

1.  **""jauh dari keramaian""**: While ""far from the crowd"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road,"" it sounds unnatural in Indonesian. A better translation would be ""terpencil"" (remote) or ""di lokasi yang tenang"" (in a quiet location).

The source text establishes a cynical and slightly informal tone through the narrator's direct speech and internal thoughts. The language is straightforward and conversational, reflecting a detective or investigator's detached yet observant perspective. The phrase ""Tell me about your dream house"" is a standard opening, but the narrator's response immediately undercuts the pleasantness with a skeptical and matter-of-fact tone. The use of colloquialisms like ""off the beaten road"" and the casual phrasing contribute to the overall informal style.

--- EVALUATION ---
The provided translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The translation is too formal and lacks the subtle cynicism present in the English text. The sentence structure feels clunky in Indonesian, and some word choices are not the most idiomatic.

For example, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum"" is a perfectly acceptable translation, but it lacks the conversational feel of ""Tell me about your dream house."" A more natural translation would be ""Hollis bertanya, sambil tersenyum, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu.""""

The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere"" is acceptable, but it would be better to use a more common Indonesian equivalent, such as ""carport"" or ""tempat parkir tertutup."" The phrase ""di luar jalur yang umum"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. A better translation would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" or ""di lokasi yang tidak biasa.""

The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" (""Of course"") feels unnatural and adds little to the flow of the conversation. It should be rephrased to avoid sounding redundant.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to improve its natural flow and capture the informal, slightly cynical tone of the original text. Here's a breakdown of specific improvements:

1. ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum. -> ""Hollis bertanya, sambil tersenyum, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu."""" (More natural conversational flow)
2. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di luar jalur yang umum."" -> ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus di tempat yang terpencil."" (More idiomatic and conveys the meaning better) or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus di lokasi yang tidak biasa.""
3.  Avoid excessive use of ""Tentu saja."" Consider rephrasing sentences to eliminate the repetition. For example, instead of ""Tentu saja, akan ada dua kamar tidur..."", try ""Rumah itu akan memiliki dua kamar tidur...""
4.  ""*Porte cochere*."" -> Consider using ""carport"" or ""tempat parkir tertutup"" for better readability. If you want to retain the original term, ensure it's explained or commonly understood in the target audience.
5. ""Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku."" -> ""Aku menunduk, sambil menggambar di meja dengan jariku."" (More natural word order)
6. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" -> ""Di belakang rumah, ada *carport* supaya kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa kena hujan."" (More natural phrasing and uses a more common term)
7. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" -> ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" (This is fine, but consider adding a transition word like ""atau"" to improve flow.)
8. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras.

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text establishes a cynical and slightly informal tone through the narrator's direct speech and internal thoughts. The language is straightforward and conversational, reflecting a detective or investigator's detached yet observant perspective. The phrase ""Tell me about your dream house"" is a standard opening, but the narrator's response immediately undercuts the pleasantness with a skeptical and matter-of-fact tone. The use of colloquialisms like ""off the beaten road"" and the casual phrasing contribute to the overall informal style.

--- EVALUATION ---
The provided translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The translation is too formal and lacks the subtle cynicism present in the English text. The sentence structure feels clunky in Indonesian, and some word choices are not the most idiomatic.

For example, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum"" is a perfectly acceptable translation, but it lacks the conversational feel of ""Tell me about your dream house."" A more natural translation would be ""Hollis bertanya, sambil tersenyum, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu.""""

The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere"" is acceptable, but it would be better to use a more common Indonesian equivalent, such as ""carport"" or ""tempat parkir tertutup."" The phrase ""di luar jalur yang umum"" is a literal translation of ""off the beaten road"" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning. A better translation would be ""di tempat yang terpencil"" or ""di lokasi yang tidak biasa.""

The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" (""Of course"") feels unnatural and adds little to the flow of the conversation. It should be rephrased to avoid sounding redundant.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs revision to improve its natural flow and capture the informal, slightly cynical tone of the original text. Here's a breakdown of specific improvements:

1. ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum. -> ""Hollis bertanya, sambil tersenyum, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu."""" (More natural conversational flow)
2. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus berada di luar jalur yang umum."" -> ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus di tempat yang terpencil."" (More idiomatic and conveys the meaning better) or ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus di lokasi yang tidak biasa.""
3.  Avoid excessive use of ""Tentu saja."" Consider rephrasing sentences to eliminate the repetition. For example, instead of ""Tentu saja, akan ada dua kamar tidur..."", try ""Rumah itu akan memiliki dua kamar tidur...""
4.  ""*Porte cochere*."" -> Consider using ""carport"" or ""tempat parkir tertutup"" for better readability. If you want to retain the original term, ensure it's explained or commonly understood in the target audience.
5. ""Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku."" -> ""Aku menunduk, sambil menggambar di meja dengan jariku."" (More natural word order)
6. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" -> ""Di belakang rumah, ada *carport* supaya kamu bisa langsung membawa belanjaan ke dapur tanpa kena hujan."" (More natural phrasing and uses a more common term)
7. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" -> ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" (This is fine, but consider adding a transition word like ""atau"" to improve flow.)
8. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak."" -> ""Di sana ada perapian, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Kamu juga bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di sana untuk memanggang steak.""

The provided translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The translation is too formal in places, which diminishes the character's voice. The phrase ""Ceritakan padaku tentang rumah impianmu"" is a literal translation and doesn't capture the casualness of ""Tell me about your dream house."" The repetition of ""Tentu"" (Of course) feels unnatural and clunky. The use of ""sambil menyesap bir"" (while taking a sip of beer) is grammatically correct but doesn't add much to the scene. The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere untuk mobil"" is accurate but lacks elegance. The overall sentence structure is often too long and convoluted, making it harder to read.

needs_revision

The translation needs significant revision to better capture the tone and natural flow of the original. Here's a breakdown of specific areas for improvement:

1. ""Ceritakan padaku tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.  -> ""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.
   *Feedback:* The Indonesian translation is too literal and lacks the conversational feel. A better option would be: ""Hollis bertanya, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu."""" or ""Hollis tersenyum dan bertanya, ""Bagaimana rumah impianmu?"""". This is more natural and avoids the overly formal ""Ceritakan padaku.""

2. ""Baiklah,"" jawabku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. -> ""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often.
   *Feedback:* ""Jarang sekali aku bicarakan"" is a bit awkward. Consider ""Bukan sesuatu yang sering aku ceritakan"" (Not something I often talk about) or ""Aku jarang membicarakannya"" (I rarely talk about it).

3. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" -> ""Of course, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan.""
   *Feedback:* The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is unnecessary. Also, the sentence is a bit long and could be broken down. Consider: ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku menginginkan tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua masalah pondok kayu biasa.""

4. ""Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga."" -> ""It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room.""
   *Feedback:* This is grammatically correct but lacks flow. ""Ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga"" is more natural.

5. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" -> ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet.""
   *Feedback:* The phrase ""di bagian belakang"" is unnecessary. Also, ""membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur"" is a bit formal. A better option would be: ""Di belakang rumah, ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa langsung masuk dapur dengan belanjaan tanpa kena hujan.""

6. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan meletakkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" -> ""There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room.""
   *Feedback:* ""Lihat?"" is too informal and doesn't translate well. ""Atau mungkin aku akan meletakkannya di samping ruang keluarga"" is a bit clunky. Consider: ""Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga.""

7. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak."" -> ""That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text establishes a cynical and slightly informal tone through the narrator's direct speech and internal thoughts. The language is straightforward and conversational, reflecting a detective or investigator's detached yet observant perspective. The phrase ""Tell me about your dream house"" is a standard opening, but the subsequent dialogue reveals a reluctance to engage with the topic, hinting at a deeper, more complex situation. The use of colloquialisms like ""off the beaten road"" and the casual tone of the conversation contribute to the overall atmosphere.

--- EVALUATION ---
The provided translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and natural flow of the original. The translation is too formal in places, which diminishes the character's voice. The phrase ""Ceritakan padaku tentang rumah impianmu"" is a literal translation and doesn't capture the casualness of ""Tell me about your dream house."" The repetition of ""Tentu"" (Of course) feels unnatural and clunky. The use of ""sambil menyesap bir"" (while taking a sip of beer) is grammatically correct but doesn't add much to the scene. The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere untuk mobil"" is accurate but lacks elegance. The overall sentence structure is often too long and convoluted, making it harder to read.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs significant revision to better capture the tone and natural flow of the original. Here's a breakdown of specific areas for improvement:

1. ""Ceritakan padaku tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.  -> ""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.
   *Feedback:* The Indonesian translation is too literal and lacks the conversational feel. A better option would be: ""Hollis bertanya, ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu."""" or ""Hollis tersenyum dan bertanya, ""Bagaimana rumah impianmu?"""". This is more natural and avoids the overly formal ""Ceritakan padaku.""

2. ""Baiklah,"" jawabku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan. -> ""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often.
   *Feedback:* ""Jarang sekali aku bicarakan"" is a bit awkward. Consider ""Bukan sesuatu yang sering aku ceritakan"" (Not something I often talk about) or ""Aku jarang membicarakannya"" (I rarely talk about it).

3. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan."" -> ""Of course, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu sungguhan.""
   *Feedback:* The repetition of ""Tentu saja"" is unnecessary. Also, the sentence is a bit long and could be broken down. Consider: ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku menginginkan tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua masalah pondok kayu biasa.""

4. ""Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga."" -> ""It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room.""
   *Feedback:* This is grammatically correct but lacks flow. ""Ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga"" is more natural.

5. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" -> ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet.""
   *Feedback:* The phrase ""di bagian belakang"" is unnecessary. Also, ""membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur"" is a bit formal. A better option would be: ""Di belakang rumah, ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa langsung masuk dapur dengan belanjaan tanpa kena hujan.""

6. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan meletakkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" -> ""There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room.""
   *Feedback:* ""Lihat?"" is too informal and doesn't translate well. ""Atau mungkin aku akan meletakkannya di samping ruang keluarga"" is a bit clunky. Consider: ""Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga.""

7. ""Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak."" -> ""That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

The source text establishes a cynical and slightly informal tone through the narrator's direct speech and internal thoughts. The language is straightforward and conversational, reflecting a detective or investigator's detached yet observant perspective. The phrase ""off the beaten road"" suggests a deliberate choice of a secluded location, adding to the mystery. The narrator's skepticism about the ""dream house"" being a simple log cabin hints at a deeper, more complex situation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The provided translation attempts to capture the basic meaning but falls short in conveying the tone and natural flow of the original. The sentence structure is often too formal and lacks the conversational feel of the English. The use of ""ujarku"" (I said) is redundant and unnatural. The translation also tends to be overly literal, resulting in clunky phrasing. For example, ""rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian"" is a correct translation but lacks the punch of ""off the beaten road."" The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere untuk mobil"" is technically accurate but doesn't convey the elegance and specific function of the term. The overall effect is a translation that reads stiffly and doesn't quite capture the narrator's voice.

6. ""Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, beserta ruang keluarga."" -> ""It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room."" (Acceptable, but could be slightly more concise: ""It would have two bedrooms and a study, plus a family room."")
7. ""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya."" -> ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" (Acceptable, but ""right off of it"" is a bit clunky. Consider ""adjacent to it"" or ""next to it."")
8. ""Aku menunduk, menggambar di meja dengan jariku."" -> ""I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger."" (Perfectly fine.)

--- CONTEXT ---
Text type: fictional text, novel excerpt
Source Language: English
Target Language: Indonesian

--- SOURCE TEXT ---
""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.

""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. ""It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.""

""Of course,"" he said, taking a sip of beer. ""

It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.""

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text establishes a cynical and slightly informal tone through the narrator's direct speech and internal thoughts. The language is straightforward and conversational, reflecting a detective or investigator's detached yet observant perspective. The phrase ""off the beaten road"" suggests a deliberate choice of a secluded location, adding to the mystery. The narrator's skepticism about the ""dream house"" being a simple log cabin hints at a deeper, more complex situation.

--- EVALUATION ---
The provided translation attempts to capture the basic meaning but falls short in conveying the tone and natural flow of the original. The sentence structure is often too formal and lacks the conversational feel of the English. The use of ""ujarku"" (I said) is redundant and unnatural. The translation also tends to be overly literal, resulting in clunky phrasing. For example, ""rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian"" is a correct translation but lacks the punch of ""off the beaten road."" The translation of ""*porte cochere*"" as ""porte cochere untuk mobil"" is technically accurate but doesn't convey the elegance and specific function of the term. The overall effect is a translation that reads stiffly and doesn't quite capture the narrator's voice.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs significant revision to improve its naturalness and accurately reflect the tone of the original. Here's a breakdown of specific improvements:

1. ""Ceritakan padaku tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.  -> ""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling. (This is fine, but the ""ujarku"" is unnecessary.)
2. ""Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali aku bicarakan."" -> ""This is something I don't talk about often."" (More natural flow.)
3. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian."" -> ""Of course, it will have to be off the beaten road."" (More idiomatic and conveys the intended meaning better.)
4. ""Aku ingin tampilannya seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya."" -> ""I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin."" (This is acceptable, but could be slightly more concise: ""I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the downsides."")
5. ""Aku menemukan rancangannya di Internet, dan aku membelinya."" -> ""I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it."" (Perfectly fine.)
6. ""Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, beserta ruang keluarga."" -> ""It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room."" (Acceptable, but could be slightly more concise: ""It would have two bedrooms and a study, plus a family room."")
7. ""Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya."" -> ""There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it."" (Acceptable, but ""right off of it"" is a bit clunky. Consider ""adjacent to it"" or ""next to it."")
8. ""Aku menunduk, menggambar di meja dengan jariku."" -> ""I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger."" (Perfectly fine.)
9. ""Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah."" -> ""Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet."" (Acceptable, but the phrase ""right into the kitchen"" is a bit redundant. Consider ""directly into the kitchen."")
10. ""Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga."" -> ""There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room."" (Perfectly fine.)

The source text establishes a cynical and slightly informal tone through the narrator's direct speech and internal thoughts. The language is straightforward and uses colloquialisms (""off the beaten road""). The meaning is clear: the narrator is investigating a potential suicide and immediately dismisses the initial assumption of a self-inflicted death. The phrase ""dream house"" is used ironically, hinting at a deeper, perhaps troubled, psyche.

--- EVALUATION ---
The provided translation is overly formal and lacks the punch of the original. The Indonesian used is grammatically correct but doesn't capture the casual, almost dismissive tone of the English. The translation tends to be verbose, which detracts from the immediacy of the dialogue. For example, ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian"" (Of course, the house must be far from the crowd) is a literal translation and doesn't convey the narrator's slightly sarcastic agreement. The use of ""menyesap bir"" (sipping beer) is fine, but the overall phrasing feels stiff. The translation also doesn't effectively convey the narrator's internal monologue and the subtle irony present in the original.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs significant revision to better capture the tone and style of the original. Here's a breakdown of specific areas for improvement:

1. ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.  -> ""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.
   *Improvement:*  ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis, sambil tersenyum tipis. (Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, with a slight smile.) Adding ""tipis"" (slight) to ""tersenyum"" better conveys the subtle, perhaps slightly mocking, nature of Hollis's smile.

2. ""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku ceritakan. -> ""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often.
   *Improvement:* ""Oke,"" jawabku pelan-pelan. Aku jarang sekali membicarakan ini. (Okay, I answered slowly. I rarely talk about this.) ""Oke"" is a more natural and common way to say ""Okay"" in Indonesian. ""Pelan-pelan"" is a good translation of ""slowly."" The second sentence is more concise and natural.

3. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin bentuknya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tetapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit."" -> ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin bentuknya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tetapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.""
   *Improvement:* ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua masalah pondok kayu yang asli. Aku menemukan gambarnya di internet, lalu membelinya. Tentu saja, aku mau sedikit mengubahnya."" (Of course, the house must be far from the crowd. I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the problems of a real log cabin. I found the picture on the internet, then bought it. Of course, I want to change it a little.) This version is more concise and uses more natural phrasing. ""Gambarnya"" (the picture) is more natural than ""rancangannya"" (its design) in this context. ""Masalah pondok kayu yang asli"" (the original problems of a log cabin) is clearer than ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the actual inconveniences of a log cabin).

4. ""Di belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi kamu bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah. Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di samping ruang keluarga. Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan kamu bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan kamu bisa meletakkan panggangan gas di teras.

--- EDITOR'S FEEDBACK ---
--- ANALYSIS ---
The source text establishes a cynical and slightly informal tone through the narrator's direct speech and internal thoughts. The language is straightforward and uses colloquialisms (""off the beaten road""). The meaning is clear: the narrator is investigating a potential suicide and immediately dismisses the initial assumption of a self-inflicted death. The phrase ""dream house"" is used ironically, hinting at a deeper, perhaps troubled, psyche.

--- EVALUATION ---
The provided translation is overly formal and lacks the punch of the original. The Indonesian used is grammatically correct but doesn't capture the casual, almost dismissive tone of the English. The translation tends to be verbose, which detracts from the immediacy of the dialogue. For example, ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian"" (Of course, the house must be far from the crowd) is a literal translation and doesn't convey the narrator's slightly sarcastic agreement. The use of ""menyesap bir"" (sipping beer) is fine, but the overall phrasing feels stiff. The translation also doesn't effectively convey the narrator's internal monologue and the subtle irony present in the original.

--- VERDICT ---
needs_revision

The translation needs significant revision to better capture the tone and style of the original. Here's a breakdown of specific areas for improvement:

1. ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis sambil tersenyum.  -> ""Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, smiling.
   *Improvement:*  ""Ceritakan tentang rumah impianmu,"" kata Hollis, sambil tersenyum tipis. (Tell me about your dream house,"" Hollis said, with a slight smile.) Adding ""tipis"" (slight) to ""tersenyum"" better conveys the subtle, perhaps slightly mocking, nature of Hollis's smile.

2. ""Baiklah,"" ujarku, perlahan. Ini adalah sesuatu yang jarang sekali ku ceritakan. -> ""Okay,"" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often.
   *Improvement:* ""Oke,"" jawabku pelan-pelan. Aku jarang sekali membicarakan ini. (Okay, I answered slowly. I rarely talk about this.) ""Oke"" is a more natural and common way to say ""Okay"" in Indonesian. ""Pelan-pelan"" is a good translation of ""slowly."" The second sentence is more concise and natural.

3. ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin bentuknya seperti pondok kayu, tetapi tanpa ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya. Aku menemukan rancangannya di internet, dan aku membelinya. Tetapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit."" -> ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian.

   *Improvement:* ""Tentu saja, rumah itu harus jauh dari keramaian. Aku ingin rumah itu terlihat seperti pondok kayu, tapi tanpa semua masalah pondok kayu yang asli. Aku menemukan gambarnya di internet, lalu membelinya. Tentu saja, aku mau sedikit mengubahnya."" (Of course, the house must be far from the crowd. I want the house to look like a log cabin, but without all the problems of a real log cabin. I found the picture on the internet, then bought it. Of course, I want to change it a little.) This version is more concise and uses more natural phrasing. ""Gambarnya"" (the picture) is more natural than ""rancangannya"" (its design) in this context. ""Masalah pondok kayu yang asli"" (the original problems of a log cabin) is clearer than ""ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya"" (the actual inconveniences of a log cabin).
