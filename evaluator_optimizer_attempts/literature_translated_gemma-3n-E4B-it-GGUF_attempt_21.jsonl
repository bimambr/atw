        "feedback": "--- ANALYSIS ---\nThe source text is a snippet from a crime novel, employing a cynical and somewhat informal tone. The phrase \"*Suicide, my ass*\" is a strong, dismissive idiom indicating disbelief. The language is direct and uses colloquialisms (\"wild girlfriend\"). The context establishes a detective investigating a murder, and the narrator is clearly annoyed by the situation. The tone is matter-of-fact, bordering on sarcastic. The challenge lies in conveying the dismissive attitude and the informal language in Indonesian while maintaining a natural flow. The use of \"Omong kosong\" is a fairly direct equivalent of \"bullshit\" or \"nonsense\" and captures the dismissive nature of the original phrase.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but lacks nuance and feels somewhat stiff.\n\n*   **\"Bunuh diri? Omong kosong,\"** - This is a good, direct translation of \"*Suicide, my ass*.\" \"Omong kosong\" effectively conveys the dismissive attitude. However, it might be *too* direct. A slightly more idiomatic translation could be considered to better capture the sarcastic tone.\n*   **\"reaksi instan dan terdiam saya.\"** - This is grammatically correct but a bit clunky. \"Terdiam\" (silent) is accurate, but the phrasing feels unnatural. A better option might be \"reaksi instan dan terdiam,\" or even \"reaksi langsung dan terdiam.\"\n*   **\"Kenapa Sybil tidak mempekerjakan saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\"** - This is a relatively accurate translation, but the sentence structure is a bit convoluted in Indonesian. It could be broken down into two shorter sentences for better readability.  The use of \"mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu\" is correct, but a more natural flow might be achieved by rephrasing the second part of the sentence.\n*   **\"Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri.\"** - This is a good, straightforward translation.\n*   **\"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar gadungannya.\"** - This is accurate, but \"pacar gadungan\" is a somewhat dated and potentially offensive term. While it accurately conveys \"wild girlfriend,\" it might be worth considering a more modern and less loaded term, depending on the target audience.\n*   **\"Saya membuka mata.\"** - This is a perfectly acceptable translation.\n*   **\"Hollis Boxleitner telah berbalik untuk melihat apa yang sedang saya lakukan.\"** - This is accurate and reads naturally.\n*   **\"Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu.\"** - This is a good translation.\n*   **\"Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" kataku.** - This is accurate and reads naturally.\n\n**Overall:** The translation is understandable and conveys the basic meaning, but it lacks the punch and naturalness of the original. It leans towards a more formal Indonesian style, which doesn't quite match the informal and cynical tone of the source text. The sentence structure in a couple of places could be improved for better flow.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\nfail",

Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar *wild*-nya. Saya membuka mata. Hollis Boxleitner berbalik melihat apa yang saya lakukan. Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu. \"Bukan bunuh diri di sini,\" ujarku.\n\n\n\n--- ANALYSIS OF REVISIONS ---\n\n*   **\"begitu reaksi instan dan terdiam saya.\"** - Replacing \"itu\" with \"begitu\" makes the sentence flow more naturally.\n*   **\"memeriksa makamnya dulu\"** -  \"Memeriksa\" (to check/examine) is a more natural verb choice than \"mengunjungi\" (to visit) in this context. Adding \"dulu\" (first/before) improves the flow.\n*   **\"Jelas-jelas anak ini bukan bunuh diri.\"** - Replacing \"Tentu saja\" with \"Jelas-jelas\" (clearly) provides a more emphatic and natural tone.\n*   **\"pacar *wild*-nya\"** - Using the English word \"wild\" in italics is a common practice in Indonesian to denote a loanword, especially when there isn't a perfect equivalent. It preserves the original feel of the phrase. While \"pacar gadungan\" is technically correct, it carries a different connotation.\n*   **\"ujarku\"** -  \"Ujarku\" is a more natural and concise way to say \"I said\" in this context. It's less formal than \"Saya berkata.\"\n\n\n\nThe revisions aim to make the translation sound more natural, informal, and closer to the original's tone while retaining accuracy.

The use of \"begitu,\" \"Jelas-jelas,\" and \"ujarku\" contributes to a more conversational tone. The retention of \"*wild*\" in italics is a strategic choice to maintain the original's flavor while acknowledging the loanword's presence in Indonesian. The revisions focus on subtle adjustments to improve readability and authenticity.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe revised translation is a significant improvement. It demonstrates a better understanding of Indonesian idiomatic expressions and a more nuanced approach to conveying the original's tone.\n\n*   **\"Bunuh diri?

The use of \"dulu\" is also well-placed.\n*   **\"Jelas-jelas anak ini bukan bunuh diri.\"** - Replacing \"Tentu saja\" with \"Jelas-jelas\" is a strong improvement, conveying a more forceful denial.\n*   **\"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar *wild*-nya.\"** - The use of \"*wild*\" is a clever solution to preserve the original's feel.\n*   **\"Saya membuka mata.\"** - Remains perfectly fine.\n*   **\"Hollis Boxleitner berbalik melihat apa yang saya lakukan.\"** - Accurate and natural.\n*   **\"Saya menatap wajah serius wakil polisi itu.\"** - Accurate and natural.\n*   **\"Bukan bunuh diri di sini,\" ujarku.** - \"Ujarku\" is a good, natural choice.\n\n**Overall:** The revised translation is much closer to the desired quality.

However, it might be *slightly* too strong depending on the desired level of formality. \"Bohong\" (lie) could be another option, though it doesn't quite convey the same level of disdain.\n*   **\"reaksi instan, dan sunyi, saya.\"** - This is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stiff. \"Saya\" is redundant after \"reaksi instan.\" A more natural phrasing would be \"reaksi instan yang sunyi dari saya\" or even \"Reaksi instan, sunyi, dari saya.\"\n*   **\"Kenapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk melihat makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\"** - This is a fairly accurate translation, but the sentence structure is a bit clunky. It could be improved to flow more naturally. For example, \"Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk memeriksa makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\" The addition of \"terlebih dahulu\" (first) improves the flow.\n*   **\"Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri.\"** - This is a good, direct translation.\n*   **\"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar gilanya.\"** - Accurate and natural.\n*   **\"Saya membuka mata.\"** - Correct and straightforward.\n*   **\"Hollis Boxleitner berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan.\"** - Accurate.\n*   **\"Saya menatap wajah serius wakil.\"** - \"Serius\" works well for \"intent\" in this context.\n*   **\"Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" kataku.** - Accurate.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   The overall tone feels slightly too formal. Consider using more colloquial language where appropriate to better capture the original's cynicism.\n*   Sentence structure in a few places is a bit awkward and could be smoothed out for better readability.\n*   The use of \"wakil\" is fine, but could be replaced with \"deputi\" if that's the preferred term in Indonesian.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\nfail",

        "feedback": "--- ANALYSIS ---\nThe goal is to revise the previous Indonesian translation to better reflect the original's informal, cynical tone and improve the natural flow of the text. The feedback focused on making the translation sound less formal and more conversational, using more colloquial language. The key changes involve replacing more formal words with their more casual equivalents and adjusting sentence structure for better readability in Indonesian.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe revised translation is a significant improvement. It successfully captures the informal tone of the original text.\n\n*   **\"Bunuh diri? Basa-basi,\"** - Excellent. \"Basa-basi\" is a very effective and natural translation of \"my ass\" in this context, conveying the same level of dismissive cynicism.\n*   **\"itu reaksi instan, dan sunyi, dari saya.\"** - The addition of \"dari saya\" is more natural than the previous attempt.\n*   **\"Kenapa Sybil nggak menyewa saya buat ngecek makamnya dulu, daripada dikirim ke hutan buat nyari Teenie?\"** - This is a substantial improvement. Using \"nggak\" instead of \"tidak\" immediately makes the sentence sound more casual. \"Ngecek\" is a very common and natural way to say \"to check\" in spoken Indonesian. \"Nyari\" is the colloquial equivalent of \"mencari\" for \"to find.\" The sentence structure is also more conversational.\n*   **\"Jelas-jelas anak ini nggak mungkin bunuh diri.\"** - Excellent. \"Jelas-jelas\" effectively conveys the certainty and dismissal of the original. \"Nggak mungkin\" is a natural and common way to say \"not possible.\"\n*   **\"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama kayak pacar edan dia.\"** - \"Edan\" is a good choice for \"wild\" or \"crazy\" in this context, maintaining the informal tone.\n*   **\"Saya buka mata.\"** - Correct and natural.\n*   **\"Hollis Boxleitner berbalik ngintip apa yang lagi saya lakuin.\"** - \"Ngintip\" is a great choice for \"check on what I was doing,\" implying a quick, casual peek. \"Lagi saya lakuin\" is a natural way to say \"what I was doing.\"\n*   **\"Saya tatap muka serius wakil itu.\"** - \"Tatap\" is a good verb choice, and \"wakil itu\" clearly identifies the deputy.\n*   **\"Nggak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" kata saya.** - Perfect.\n\n**Overall:** The revised translation is a very strong and natural-sounding Indonesian version of the original text. The use of colloquial language is appropriate and effective, and the sentence structures are well-suited for conversational Indonesian. The improvements are significant and successfully address the previous shortcomings.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\npass",

The tone is somewhat aggressive and accusatory, reflecting the speaker's feeling of being unfairly judged. \"Impugn our honor\" is a slightly formal phrase used to emphasize the severity of the offense. The core meaning revolves around feeling disrespected and having one's integrity questioned. The challenge lies in conveying this blend of informality and the specific nuance of \"impugn.\"\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but suffers from awkward phrasing and a slightly unnatural tone in Indonesian. Let's break it down phrase by phrase:\n\n*   \"I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster\" -> \"Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti penipu ulung\" - This is a fairly direct and acceptable translation. \"Penipu ulung\" (master swindler) is a good equivalent for \"confidence trickster.\"\n*   \"and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less.\" -> \"dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih membencinya.\" - This is accurate, but \"bahkan lebih membencinya\" (even more hates it) sounds a bit clunky. A smoother alternative might be \"dan aku yakin Tolliver bahkan lebih tidak menyukainya.\" (and I'm sure Tolliver even less likes it).\n*   \"I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick.\" -> \"Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kesadaranku.\" - \"Menyentuh kesadaranku\" (touch my consciousness) is a literal translation of \"touch my quick\" but doesn't capture the intended meaning. \"Quick\" in this context refers to a person's sensitive nerve or core self, a vulnerable point. A better translation would be something like \"Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka menyentuh kelemahanku\" (I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my weakness) or \"Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan tidak membiarkan mereka mengusikku\" (I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them bother me/disturb me).\n*   \"Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful.\" -> \"Tolliver mencoba melakukan hal itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil.\" - This is a straightforward and accurate translation.\n*   \"He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.\" -> \"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang mencoreng kehormatan kami.\" - \"Mencoreng kehormatan\" (to stain honor) is a decent translation of \"impugn our honor,\" but it lacks the formality and weight of the original. A more suitable translation would be \"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang meragukan kehormatan kami\" (He gets very upset when people doubt our honor) or \"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang-orang menyerang kehormatan kami\" (He gets very upset when people attack our honor).\n\nThe overall translation is understandable, but it lacks the punch and nuance of the original.

The meaning revolves around feeling unfairly targeted and having one's integrity questioned. \"Touch my quick\" is a figurative expression meaning to provoke or upset someone deeply. \"Impugn our honor\" means to attack or discredit someone's reputation or integrity. The context suggests a tense relationship between the speaker and Tolliver, likely involving some form of conflict or disagreement.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\nThe revised translation is a significant improvement. The changes address the issues identified in the previous evaluation, resulting in a more natural and nuanced Indonesian rendering.\n\n*   **\"Aku tidak suka diperlakukan seperti orang yang mencoba menipu\"**: This is a better translation of \"I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster\" than the previous attempt. It captures the core meaning without sounding overly formal.\n*   **\"dan aku yakin Tolliver pasti lebih membencinya\"**: This is a good translation and maintains the intended meaning.\n*   **\"Aku menarik diri ke dalam diriku sendiri, dan aku tidak membiarkan mereka memprovokasiku.\"**: Replacing \"menyentuh sarafku\" with \"memprovokasiku\" is a crucial improvement. It's a more idiomatic and natural way to express the idea of being deeply affected or provoked.\n*   **\"Tolliver mencoba melakukan itu juga, tetapi dia kurang berhasil.\"**: This remains a solid translation.\n*   **\"Dia sangat kesal ketika orang menyerang reputasi kami.\"**: This is a better translation of \"impugn our honor\" than \"mencoreng kehormatan kami.\" \"Menyerang reputasi\" is a more common and impactful way to convey the idea of discrediting someone's reputation.\n\nThe revised translation successfully captures the original's tone and meaning while sounding more natural in Indonesian. The use of more idiomatic expressions significantly enhances the overall quality of the translation. The changes demonstrate a better understanding of Indonesian phrasing and a greater attention to nuance.\n\n\n\n--- VERDICT ---\npass",

The translation is accurate, but \"mengatakan\" (to say) is a bit formal in this context. \"Mengatakan\" is not incorrect, but \"mengaku\" (to admit/confess) or \"mengatakan\" (to say) would be more natural.\n*   **\"It will have to be off the beaten road, of course.

Tapi tentu saja, aku ingin mengubahnya sedikit.\" The translation is mostly accurate, but the phrasing is a bit clunky. \"Jauh dari keramaian\" is a literal translation of \"off the beaten road\" and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning of remoteness or seclusion. \"Ketidaknyamanan pondok kayu yang sebenarnya\" is also a bit awkward. A better phrasing might be \"tanpa masalah yang biasanya ada di pondok kayu\" (without the usual problems of a log cabin). \"Mengubahnya sedikit\" is also a bit weak; \"memodifikasinya sedikit\" (to modify it a little) would sound more natural.\n*   **\"Of course,\" he said, taking a sip of beer.** - \"Tentu,\" katanya sambil menyesap bir.

The style is straightforward and uses simple language, with a touch of descriptive detail. The phrase \"*porte cochere*\" is a bit of a challenge, requiring a translation that conveys the meaning of a covered driveway or portico. The overall meaning is clear – the speaker is outlining the features of a house they are designing or envisioning. The target language, Indonesian, requires a natural and flowing translation that preserves the conversational tone.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe translation is generally good but contains some awkward phrasing and a missed opportunity for more natural Indonesian.\n\n*   **\"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.\"** - This is a correct and natural translation of \"It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room.\" No issues here.\n*   **\"Ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya.\"** - \"There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it.\" This is a good translation. \"Tepat di sampingnya\" is a natural way to say \"right off of it.\"\n*   **\"Aku menunduk, menggambar dengan jariku di atas meja.\"** - \"I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger.\" This is accurate and reads well.\n*   **\"Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.\"** - \"Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet.\" The translation of *porte cochere* as \"porte cochere untuk mobil\" is acceptable, but a more common Indonesian phrase might be better (see feedback below). \"Tanpa basah-basah\" is a natural way to express \"without getting wet.\"\n*   **\"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di sisi ruang keluarga.\"** - \"There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room.\" This is a good translation. \"Lihat?\" is a natural way to add emphasis, similar to \"see?\".\n*   **\"Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras.\"** - \"That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck.\" Accurate and natural.\n*   **\"Dan Anda bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak.\"** - \"And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.\" This is accurate and natural.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   The translation of \"*porte cochere*\" is technically correct but sounds somewhat formal and less common than other options. A more natural Indonesian translation might be \"carport\" or \"tempat parkir tertutup\" (covered parking space), depending on the desired level of formality.  While \"porte cochere\" is understandable, it might sound a bit unnatural to a native Indonesian speaker.\n*   While the translation is accurate, the overall flow could be slightly improved by varying sentence structure a bit more. The sentences are mostly short and declarative.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\nfail",

The phrase \"*porte cochere*\" is a French term referring to a covered passage for vehicles, and its meaning needs to be conveyed accurately in Indonesian. The overall meaning is straightforward: a description of a house with specific features and their locations.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but suffers from awkward phrasing and a lack of natural flow in Indonesian.\n\n*   **\"It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room.\"** - \"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.\" This is a direct and acceptable translation.\n*   **\"There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it.\"** - \"Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya.\" \"Tepat di sampingnya\" is a bit formal and less natural than a more colloquial phrase. \"Di sampingnya\" is better.\n*   **\"I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger.\"** - \"Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku.\" This is accurate and natural.\n*   **\"Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet.\"** - \"Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.\" The use of the loanword \"*porte cochere*\" is acceptable, but it lacks explanation.  Ideally, a brief explanation or synonym could be added for clarity, especially for a wider audience. \"Langsung ke dapur\" is slightly awkward; \"langsung ke dapur tanpa perlu keluar\" (directly to the kitchen without needing to go outside) would be more natural.\n*   **\"There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room.\"** - \"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan menempatkannya di sisi ruang keluarga.\" \"Lihat?\" is a direct translation of \"see?\" and feels a bit clunky. A more natural phrasing might be \"bukan?\" (isn't it?) or simply omitting it.\n*   **\"That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.\"** - \"Di sanalah perapian akan berada, dan Anda bisa menyimpan kayu bakar di teras. Dan Anda bisa meletakkan pemanggang gas di teras. Untuk steak.\" This is accurate but lacks the conversational feel of the original. \"Untuk steak\" feels a bit stiff. A more natural phrasing would be \"Supaya bisa memanggang steak.\" (So you can grill steaks).\n\nOverall, the translation is understandable, but it lacks the natural flow and informality of the original. The use of \"*porte cochere*\" without explanation is a missed opportunity.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\nfail",

The style is direct and conversational, typical of a detective narrating their thoughts. The meaning is straightforward: the narrator is immediately skeptical of the initial assumption of suicide and concludes that a murder has occurred. The phrase \"Suicide, my ass\" is a strong expression of disbelief. \"Wild girlfriend\" implies a woman with a rebellious or unconventional personality. The context is a crime scene investigation, specifically the discovery of a body and the immediate assessment of the cause of death. The challenge lies in conveying the informal tone and the narrator's skepticism while maintaining natural-sounding Indonesian.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but lacks the punch and informal tone of the original.\n\n*   **\"Bunuh diri? Omong kosong\"**: This is a decent translation of \"Suicide, my ass,\" but \"omong kosong\" is a bit too mild. While understandable, it doesn't capture the dismissive, almost aggressive sentiment of the original. A stronger option might be \"Bunuh diri? Jangan bodoh!\" (Suicide? Don't be stupid!) or even something more emphatic depending on the desired level of informality.\n*   **\"Mengapa Sybil tidak menyewa saya untuk mengunjungi makamnya terlebih dahulu, alih-alih mengirim saya ke hutan untuk mencari Teenie?\"**: This is grammatically correct but feels somewhat clunky. The sentence structure is overly formal for the narrator's voice. A more natural phrasing could be: \"Kenapa Sybil tidak suruh aku lihat makamnya dulu, daripada nyuruh aku cari Teenie di hutan?\" (Why didn't Sybil ask me to see his grave first, instead of sending me to find Teenie in the forest?) This option uses more colloquial language (\"suruh,\" \"nyuruh\") to better reflect the narrator's tone.\n*   **\"Tentu saja anak ini tidak bunuh diri.\"**: This is a perfectly acceptable translation.\n*   **\"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti kekasihnya yang keras kepala itu.\"**: \"Keras kepala\" is a good translation of \"wild girlfriend\" and accurately conveys the intended meaning.\n*   **\"Saya membuka mata.\"**: This is a simple and accurate translation.\n*   **\"Saya menatap wajah serius wakil sheriff itu.\"**: This is accurate but slightly formal. \"Menatap\" (staring) is fine, but perhaps a more natural phrasing could be \"Saya melihat wajah serius wakil sheriff itu\" (I saw the serious face of the deputy).\n*   **\"Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" kataku.** This is a direct and accurate translation.\n\nOverall, the translation is understandable but lacks the stylistic flair and informal tone of the original.

The style is direct and conversational, employing short sentences and contractions to create a sense of immediacy. The phrase \"Suicide, my ass\" is a strong idiom expressing disbelief and sarcasm. The reference to \"Teenie\" and \"Dell Teague\" suggests a pre-existing narrative and familiarity within the story.

        "feedback": "--- ANALYSIS ---\nThe previous translation attempted to improve the impact and naturalness of the Indonesian version. The changes include replacing \"Omong kosong\" with the more emphatic \"Masa sih!\" (How could that be!), rephrasing the question about Sybil to be more idiomatic, and using \"gila\" instead of \"gilanya\" to sound more natural in the context of a relationship. The goal is to capture the sarcastic and dismissive tone of the original English.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\nThe revised translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. The changes made address the issues identified earlier and result in a more natural and impactful Indonesian rendition.\n\n*   **\"Bunuh diri? Masa sih!\"** This is a much better translation of \"Suicide, my ass.\" \"Masa sih!\" conveys the same sense of disbelief and sarcasm more effectively than \"Omong kosong.\"\n*   **\"Kenapa Sybil tidak menyuruh saya memeriksa makamnya dulu, daripada mengirim saya mencari Teenie di hutan?\"** This is a more natural and idiomatic phrasing than the previous attempt. It flows better and sounds less literal.\n*   **\"Jelas-jelas anak ini tidak bunuh diri.\"** This is a strong and clear statement, accurately conveying the narrator's certainty.\n*   **\"Dell Teague dibunuh, sama seperti pacar gila nya.\"** The use of \"gila nya\" is more natural and conversational.\n*   **\"Saya membuka mata.\"** Correct and natural.\n*   **\"Hollis Boxleitner berbalik untuk melihat apa yang saya lakukan.\"** Accurate and natural.\n*   **\"Saya menatap wajah serius wakil itu.\"** The addition of \"itu\" (that) is a subtle but important detail that adds to the naturalness of the sentence.\n*   **\"Tidak ada bunuh diri di sini,\" kataku.** Accurate and natural.\n\n**Overall Coherence:** The revised translation is now much closer to capturing the tone and style of the original English. The language is more natural, the phrasing is more idiomatic, and the sarcasm is more effectively conveyed. The changes are well-considered and demonstrate a good understanding of the source text and the target language. The translation is now a strong and accurate representation of the original.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\npass",

        "feedback": "--- ANALYSIS ---\n\nThe source text employs a somewhat informal, slightly cynical tone. The language is direct and uses figurative language (\"touch my quick\" - a metaphor for accessing one's thoughts/vulnerabilities). The context suggests a tense relationship between the narrator and Tolliver, possibly involving accusations or betrayals. The phrase \"impugn our honor\" is relatively formal, adding a layer of seriousness to the situation. The core meaning revolves around the narrator's defensiveness and Tolliver's sensitivity to perceived slights. The challenge lies in conveying the blend of informality and the underlying seriousness in Indonesian.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\n\nThe translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues in naturalness and nuance.\n\n*   **\"penipu ulung\"**: While \"penipu ulung\" (master swindler) accurately translates \"confidence trickster,\" it's a bit too strong and formal for the tone of the original. \"Penipu\" (swindler) would be more appropriate and less emphatic.\n*   **\"kesadaranku\"**: \"Kesadaran\" (consciousness) is not the correct translation for \"quick\" in this context. \"Kesadaran\" implies awareness, not the quickness of thought or vulnerability. A better translation would be something like \"pikiran\" (mind) or \"pemikiran\" (thoughts).\n*   **\"kurang berhasil\"**: This is a grammatically correct but somewhat stiff translation of \"less successful.\" \"Tidak berhasil\" would be more natural.\n*   **\"mencoreng kehormatan kami\"**: \"Mencoreng\" (to stain, tarnish) is accurate, but \"kehormatan\" (honor) feels a bit too formal and weighty in this context. \"Reputasi\" (reputation) or even a more colloquial phrase might be better.\n*   **Overall Coherence:** The sentence structure is mostly correct, but the phrasing in several places feels unnatural and clunky. The Indonesian translation lacks the subtle cynicism and immediacy of the original. The flow is somewhat disrupted by the overly formal word choices.\n\nThe translation correctly conveys the basic meaning, but it doesn't capture the original's tone or flow.

The tone is informal and slightly whimsical, reflecting the speaker's imaginative planning. The style is simple and direct, using everyday language. The phrase \"*porte cochere*\" is a specific architectural term, indicating a covered entrance for cars. This requires careful consideration in translation to ensure the Indonesian equivalent accurately conveys the meaning without sounding overly formal or unnatural. The overall meaning is a visualization of a house design with a focus on convenience and comfort. The speaker is presenting ideas rather than stating definitive plans.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\nThe translation is generally accurate but suffers from several issues related to naturalness and consistency.\n\n1. **\"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, serta ruang keluarga.\"** - This is a correct and straightforward translation of \"It would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room.\" No issues here.\n\n2. **\"Akan ada dapur di sini, dengan kamar mandi tepat di sampingnya.\"** - Correct. \"There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it.\"\n\n3. **\"Aku menunduk melihat meja, menggambar dengan jariku.\"** - Correct. \"I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger.\"\n\n4. **\"Di bagian belakang, akan ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi Anda bisa membawa belanjaan langsung ke dapur tanpa basah-basah.\"** - The translation of \"*porte cochere*\" as \"porte cochere untuk mobil\" is technically correct but sounds very formal and unnatural in Indonesian.

For steaks.\"\n\n**Overall Coherence:** The translation is understandable, but the language feels somewhat stiff and lacks the casual tone of the original. The use of \"akan ada\" (it will be) repeatedly makes it sound more like a formal description than a casual conversation. The translation doesn't fully capture the speaker's playful and imaginative tone. The awkward phrasing around the *porte cochere* is a significant weakness.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\nfail",

        "feedback": "--- ANALYSIS ---\nThe source text remains the same as before. The key challenge is maintaining the casual, conversational tone while making the Indonesian translation sound natural and flowing. The phrase \"*porte cochere*\" is still the most problematic, requiring a more idiomatic equivalent. The speaker is presenting ideas and possibilities, so the translation should reflect this flexibility and informality.\n\n--- EVALUATION ---\nThe revised translation is a significant improvement over the previous attempt. The changes address the issues of unnatural phrasing and formality, resulting in a more conversational and natural-sounding Indonesian text.\n\n1. **\"Akan ada dua kamar tidur dan ruang kerja, plus ruang keluarga.\"** - The addition of \"plus\" is a good, informal touch.\n\n2. **\"Dapur ada di sini, dan kamar mandi persis di sebelahnya.\"** -  More natural than the previous phrasing.\n\n3. **\"Aku menunduk, menggambar di meja dengan jari.\"** - Minor improvement, flows better.\n\n4. **\"Di belakang rumah, ada *porte cochere* untuk mobil, jadi belanja bisa langsung dibawa ke dapur tanpa kena hujan.\"** - The use of \"*porte cochere*\" followed by a clear explanation is effective. \"Tanpa kena hujan\" is a natural way to express \"without getting wet.\"\n\n5. **\"Ada teras di sisi kanan dapur, lihat? Atau mungkin aku akan bikin teras di sisi ruang keluarga.\"** - \"Bikin teras\" is a very natural and common way to say \"to make a terrace.\"\n\n6. **\"Di sana nanti ada perapian, dan kayu bakar bisa disimpan di teras. Terus, ada juga tempat memanggang gas di teras. Buat steak.\"** - \"Nanti\" adds a sense of future possibility, fitting the speaker's planning. \"Terus\" is a good conversational filler. \"Buat steak\" is a natural and informal way to say \"for steaks.\"\n\n**Overall Coherence:** The revised translation successfully captures the casual tone and conversational flow of the original. The use of more idiomatic Indonesian phrases makes the text sound much more natural and less like a literal translation. The handling of \"*porte cochere*\" is effective, providing clarity without sounding overly formal. The translation accurately conveys the speaker's imaginative and flexible approach to designing the house.\n\n--- VERDICT ---\npass",
