nuance_preservation: False",needs_revision,"While the translation demonstrates reasonable semantic accuracy, capturing the core meaning of the English text, it unfortunately fails on several crucial fronts. The tone is significantly off. 'Bunuh diri, masa bodoh' translates 'Suicide, my ass' literally, but it lacks the sarcastic, dismissive, and slightly cynical tone of the original. 'Masa bodoh' is a very common phrase meaning 'don't care' or 'nonsense,' which doesn't convey the same level of disdain and disbelief as 'my ass' in this context. This tonal mismatch fundamentally alters the character's voice and the overall atmosphere of the excerpt. Furthermore, the translation misses the subtle nuance of the original. The phrase 'my ass' is a deliberately vulgar and emphatic expression of disbelief. The Indonesian translation, while understandable, lacks this impactful element. Similarly, the use of 'wakil' for 'deputy' is grammatically correct but lacks the slightly more formal or perhaps even slightly archaic feel that might be appropriate for the character and setting. The natural fluency is acceptable, but the tonal and nuance failures are significant enough to warrant a 'needs_revision' grade.

It doesn't convey the same sense of being deeply manipulated or having one's essence violated.

The overall effect is a translation that is understandable but lacks the subtle sharpness and emotional weight present in the source text.
