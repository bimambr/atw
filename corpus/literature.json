        "*Suicide, my ass*, was my instant, and silent, reaction. Why hadn't Sybil hired me to come out here to read his grave first, instead of sending me to the woods to find Teenie? Of course this boy hadn't shot himself. Dell Teague had been murdered, just like his wild girlfriend. I opened my eyes. Hollis Boxleitner had swung around to check on what I was doing. I looked into the intent face of the deputy. \"No suicide here,\" I said.",
        "I don't like being treated like a confidence trickster, and I'm sure Tolliver likes it even less. I retreat inside myself, and I don't let them touch my quick. Tolliver tries to do that, too, but he is less successful. He gets very upset when people impugn our honor.",
        "\"Tell me about your dream house,\" Hollis said, smiling.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, slowly. This was something I didn't talk about too often. \"It will have to be off the beaten road, of course. I want it to look like a log cabin, but without the inconveniences of a real log cabin. I found a plan on the Internet, and I bought it. But of course, I want to alter it a little.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, taking a sip of beer. \"\n\nIt would be two bedrooms and a study, with a family room. There'd be a kitchen here, with the washroom right off of it.\" I was looking down at the table, drawing with my finger. \"Around back, there'd be a *porte cochere* for the cars, so you could carry groceries right into the kitchen without getting wet. There's a deck off the right side of the kitchen, see? Or maybe I'd put it off the family room. That's where the fireplace will be, and you could keep your firewood on the deck. And you could put your gas grill on the deck. For steaks.\""
